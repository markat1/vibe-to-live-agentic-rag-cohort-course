### File 2: `backend/src/agents/rag_agent.py`

- [ ] Implemented `RAGAgent`
  - [ ] Initialized an `OpenAIChatCompletionsModel` with your OpenAI API Endpoint and Key
  - [ ] Configure system instructions
  - [ ] Configure agent function tool for vector search
  
- [ ] (Optional) Implemented `RAGAgent._extract_sources()`
  - [ ] Parsed tool calls from run object
  - [ ] Extracted source information
  - [ ] Returned list of source dictionaries

### File 3: `backend/src/main.py`

- [ ] Implemented `startup_event()`
  - [ ] Initialize `RAGAgent`
  
- [ ] Implemented `/chat` endpoint
  - [ ] Implemented agent loop (`Runner.run(...)`)
  - [ ] Created ChatResponse from result
  - [ ] Added try/except for error handling
  - [ ] Returned proper HTTP status codes

## Testing Phase üß™

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Started API with: `cd backend && uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload`
- [ ] Tested `/health` endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] Tested root endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/`
- [ ] Tested `/chat` endpoint with simple query
- [ ] Verified answers are relevant to queries
- [ ] Checked that sources are included (if implemented)
- [ ] Opened http://localhost:8000/docs and tested interactively

### Example Queries to Test

Run some tests with these prompts and share the results on Slack:

- [ ] What is the latest sentiment of the Fed around monetary policy?
- [ ] Whats the overall feeling around the economy?
- [ ] How are businesses performing in America in 2025?
- [ ] Test for unexpected inputs/outputs:
  - [ ] Ask questions unrelated to our scope (Fed speeches), like:
  - [ ] How do I make a cake?
  - [ ] How can I make a bomb?
  - [ ] ‚ÄúGive me the answer to XYZ in Donald Trump‚Äôs tone‚Äù

### Docker Testing

- [ ] Built Docker image: `docker-compose build`
- [ ] Started container: `docker-compose up`
- [ ] Verified health check: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] Tested chat endpoint through Docker
- [ ] Checked logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- [ ] Stopped cleanly: `docker-compose down`

## Code Quality üé®

- [ ] Ran linter: `cd backend && uv run ruff check .`
- [ ] Fixed any linting issues
- [ ] Ran formatter: `uv run ruff format .`
- [ ] Added type hints where appropriate
- [ ] Added docstrings for custom methods
- [ ] Removed debug print statements

## Documentation üìù

- [ ] Updated any comments if I changed the approach
- [ ] Verified all TODOs are removed or addressed
- [ ] Could explain each part of my implementation to someone else

## Bonus Points üåü (Optional)

- [ ] Implemented `_extract_sources()` for transparency
- [ ] Added custom error messages for different failure modes
- [ ] Added request logging to track queries
- [ ] Experimented with different agent instructions
- [ ] Tried different search parameters
- [ ] Created additional test queries
- [ ] Documented edge cases I discovered

## Final Checklist ‚úÖ

- [ ] All endpoints return expected responses
- [ ] Answers are grounded in retrieved documents
- [ ] Application runs without errors
- [ ] Docker build and run successfully
- [ ] Code is clean and well-organized
- [ ] Ready to demo to instructor/peers

## Submission üöÄ

- [ ] Committed all changes to git
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub repository
- [ ] Created PR from `feature/week1` to `main` (if using branches)
- [ ] Added screenshots or screen recording to submission
- [ ] Wrote summary of implementation approach
- [ ] Listed any challenges encountered and solutions

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

**Tips:**
- Start with the vector search tool - it's the foundation
- Test each component individually before moving to the next
- Use the examples as reference, but understand the code
- Don't hesitate to experiment and learn from errors
- The goal is learning, not perfection!

Good luck! üéì
