But there are also important similarities across these central banks. As independent central banks, our objective is to set policy that will result in the best outcomes for the people we each serve. Another similarity, and one I would like to focus on today, is that both the ECB and the Fed see value in establishing and clearly articulating to the public a framework on how we each approach monetary policymaking. And, in fact, both the ECB and the Fed published revisions to our individual framework documents earlier this year. Such revisions lead to more robust frameworks that help support the mission of central banks across a broad range of economic conditions, including those that are also shaped by geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts, as is the theme of this conference.\n\nToday, I will brieflyreviewsome consistent themes that emerged from the two revised documents. Then, I will discuss in more depth the changes to the Fed'sStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which Chair Powell announced in his Jackson Hole speech in August. Finally, I will offer my views on the economic outlook and its implications for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nConsistent ThemesUnderstanding the work of other central banks and speaking with their policymakers is a healthy exercise. This is particularly true when studying other banks' overarching frameworks. The ECB's Monetary Policy Strategy Statement dates to the central bank's founding in 1998. The Fed is quite a bit older, but it still took us longer to offer a formal framework to the public. The Fed's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was first issued in 2012, under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. At the time, Fed leaders took note that other peer central banks issued public statements of their frameworks and saw value in doing so. While the two documents differ in length and touch on some slightly different topics, reflecting each bank's unique mandate, there are several similarities. One is that the governing bodies of both the ECB and the Fed target 2 percent inflation. Another is that they both have a commitment to revisiting and revising their framework periodically. Also, both revised documents de-emphasized their previous focus on operating near the effective lower bound (ELB) of interest rates in favor of considering a broad range of economic circumstances.\n\nOverall, both documents describe the central bank's understanding of its monetary policy mandates and its broad approach to achieving them. However, neither is a mandatory policy prescription. Indeed, each framework provides a structure within which its respective policymakers can develop their individual policy views. That is a good thing. It is a sign of a healthy, independent central bank. Robust discussions where alternative viewpoints are considered are more likely to lead to effective policies and better outcomes for the people we serve.\n\nThe Fed's Revised FrameworkNow, let me turn specifically to the framework document my Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) colleagues and I finished revising in August. The Fed's dual mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices, which was given to us by the U.S. Congress, underpins the Fed's monetary policy framework. Our commitment to delivering on our dual mandate is unwavering. The revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions.\n\nWe often refer to the framework document as the \"consensus statement.\" We call it that because it reflects the consensus view of the FOMC—and because having a nine-word title for a two-page document is a bit verbose!\n\nThe FOMC created the revised consensus statement after conducting a public review, the second time the Committee has done so. That review consisted of three elements: first, we heldFed Listensevents around the U.S., where members of the public could share their views with policymakers; second, we hosted an academic research conference that featured presentations from leading experts, including former Chair Bernanke; and third, we convened a series of policymaker discussions and deliberations at FOMC meetings this year, supported by staff analysis.\n\nThe statement is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective. The changes implemented as a result of this review were a logical progression, not a change in course, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. I will make note offour adjustmentsto the consensus statement and discuss each in turn.\n\nFirst, the revised consensus statement removed language emphasizing the ELB as a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, it states that our monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions. This revision, reflecting a move away from the post–financial crisis era of historically low interest rates, makes our framework more robust. It is useful to recall that at the time of the FOMC's previous framework review, during 2019 and 2020, policymakers were considering an economy that had for many years demonstrated low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve—meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy. The overarching concern for central bankers at that time was how to operate with interest rates near the ELB. Today, of course, we are operating in a very different environment, at least in part brought on by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSecond, the revised framework embraces a flexible inflation-targeting approach at all times and eliminates a \"makeup\" strategy that would be employed in certain circumstances. The experience since the pandemic highlights different challenges to achieving our inflation mandate, such as supply shocks, sectoral developments, and nonlinear inflation dynamics. The flexible inflation targeting in our revised framework allows us to take a balanced approach in promoting our goals, considering the extent of departures from them. The revised framework appropriately emphasizes the Committee's commitment to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\n\nThird, the revised consensus statement provides clarity around how the Committee thinks about maximum employment. The 2020 version of the statement indicated that the Fed would mitigate \"shortfalls\" from maximum employment. The shortfalls strategy grew out of the insight that real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment—and hence of \"maximum employment\"—are highly uncertain. However, the use of the word \"shortfalls\" created some communications challenges, as it was not intended to be a commitment to always avoid preemption or to ignore tight labor market conditions. As a result, it was removed from the consensus statement. Instead, the revised document more precisely states that \"the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability.\"2As Chair Powell pointed out, preemptive action could well be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability. The revised statement defines maximum employment as \"the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.\"3\n\nFourth, and closely aligned with the change I just discussed, the FOMC clarified its approach to monetary policy in times when the employment and inflation sides of our mandate may be at odds. The revised statement says that, in such periods, the Committee will follow \"a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the extent of departures from its goals and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.\" The revised language more closely aligns with the original 2012 statement. It is also consistent with the Committee's actions during the 2022–24 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\n\nWhile I have highlighted multiple changes, it is also important to note thecontinuitywith the Fed's past framework statements. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We also continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. We have never set a numerical goal for employment because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to policy. Likewise, we maintained our commitment to a 2 percent inflation objective because that is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. And we remain committed to conducting a public review roughly every five years.\n\nWhile the framework provides a structure through which to think about policy decisions, I will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Consistent with such a determination, I would like to share with you my current outlook for the U.S. economy.\n\nEconomic OutlookRecent data indicate that U.S. economic growth has moderated, and the risks to both sides of our dual mandate have shifted. Employment growth has slowed because of weaker growth in labor supply and a softening in labor demand. The uptick in the unemployment rate suggests that demand has fallen by a bit more than supply and that the downside risks to employment are rising. Meanwhile, higher tariffs are showing through to higher inflation for some goods. I expect that the effects of tariffs on inflation, employment, and economic activity will further show through in coming months.\n\nThe softening of labor market activity comes as overall economic activity has moderated this year. In the first half of 2025,U.S. GDPgrew at about a 1.5 percent annual rate, which reflects a marked cooling from last year's 2.5 percent growth rate. The slowdown in economic activity in the first half of this year was primarily driven by weaker consumer spending. That said, U.S. retail spending picked up over the summer. Overall, I expect the U.S. economy to maintain the first half's rate of growth through the remainder of the year.\n\nIn terms of the labor market, there has been notable slowing in both labor supply and labor demand. Net immigration into the U.S., an important contributor to workforce growth, has dropped sharply. At the same time, total employment growth has slowed. Over the past three months, American employers have added just 29,000jobs to payrollsa month on average. The recent pace of employment growth has been the slowest since the U.S. economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic recession, which is largely explained by the slower growth in the labor force. There are other measures of the labor market that also bear watching. For example, theratioof unfilled jobs to unemployed Americans seeking work remains near 1. And measures of job openings and initial jobless claims have been mostly moving sideways.\n\nA low level of job creation would historically put upward pressure on theunemployment rate, though so far that effect has been muted because of the decline in labor force growth. The U.S. unemployment rate in August was 4.3 percent, a still relatively low rate, and up just 0.1 percentage point from August of the previous year. The unemployment rate could edge a bit higher this year before moving back down next year.\n\nTurning to the other side of our dual mandate, it remains notable that inflation has slowed considerably from the highs that occurred when the economy reopened after pandemic disruptions. Inflation, however, remains somewhat above our 2 percent target, and the tariffs that have been announced and implemented so far are showing up in some goods prices. Overall, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August.Core PCE inflation—which removes volatile food and energy prices—was 2.9 percent in August. Often, it is helpful to study the three majorcomponents of core PCE inflation. Currently, core goods prices have been rising, reflecting tariff effects. In contrast, core services inflation, outside of housing, has generally trended sideways this year, while housing inflation appears to be on a gradual downward trend.\n\nI view the uncertainty around my baseline outlook as especially high, mainly due to the new policies being introduced by the current U.S. Administration and their effects on employment and inflation. As the changes in these policies are finalized and we have more time to judge how they are affecting the economy, I expect some of the broader uncertainty around the U.S. economy to diminish.\n\nMonetary PolicyConsidering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the downside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate are under pressure.\n\nWhile tariff-related inflation is apparent in the prices of some goods, it is also notable that it so far has been lower than what many forecasters predicted this spring. Several factors—including the final tariff rates, the extent of pass-through to consumer prices, the effects on supply chains, overall economic conditions, and what happens to longer-run inflation expectations—will influence the scope and persistence of the related rise in inflation. Short-term inflation expectations have come down from the peaks reached in the second quarter, and most measures of longer-run inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American people understand our commitment to returning inflation to our 2 percent target. As such, I expect the disinflation process to resume after this year and inflation to return to the 2 percent target in the coming years.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, the labor market is softening, which suggests that, left unsupported, it could experience stress. To balance the risk of persistent above-target inflation and the risk of a deteriorating labor market, I supported a 25 basis point cut in our target range at the last FOMC meeting. This change moved ourpolicy ratecloser to a more neutral stance while maintaining a balanced approach to promoting our dual-mandate objectives.\n\nWith respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to evaluate the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I will also consider and assess information about government policies and their effects on the economy.\n\nConclusionIn this room, I know that I am not alone in putting careful thought and attention into what should be the proper path of monetary policy moving forward. I have found the Fed's consensus statement to be a valuable tool in helping me organize my thinking and take a grounded approach to policymaking. I know that similar documents at your central banks also provide wise counsel to pursue your mandates.\n\nThank you again for the invitation to speak here and for allowing me to engage in the sharing of ideas.\n\n1.

{"title": "Waller, The Next Frontier of Payments Innovation", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250929a.htm", "author": "Waller", "subject": "The Next Frontier of Payments Innovation", "description": "Speech At Sibos 2025, Frankfurt, Germany", "category": "Speech", "pub_date": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 11:30:00 GMT", "content": "Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.1The theme for Sibos this year, \"the next frontiers of global finance\" is a fitting one. We are indeed witnessing a new frontier of innovation in payments and the broader financial system. New technologies like distributed ledgers, tokenized assets, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to make payments smarter, faster, and more efficient. I know many of you in the audience today represent firms that are using the latest cutting-edge advances to bring new global solutions to the market.\n\nThe conference theme also accurately captures that we are at thenextfrontier. I often note that the modern history of payments is a story of technological innovation.2The history spans from the last century, when payments and securities transfers were converted from paper to electronic solutions, to the present day when we increasingly have payment systems that process transactions in real time, 24/7.\n\nLastly, the conference theme recognizes the global nature of payments and financial infrastructures that underpin international commerce. Of particular focus in this domain are cross-border payments, which involve transactions across a layered and complex set of networks and experience frictions that contribute to higher costs, slower speeds, limited transparency, and barriers to access. Multiple opportunities for improvement exist in international payments, including improvements to smaller-value remittances, business-to-business payments, and collateral management in capital markets.\n\nAs we enter the next frontier, let us remember that this is not a new story and that we should not fear new technologies, nor new types of providers. Instead, we should ask how new technologies could benefit all types of actors, including the most sophisticated financial firms as well as consumers, while not losing sight of the need for guardrails that promote safety for consumers and the broader financial system. In addition, we should ask how new technologies could be used to upgrade the infrastructures that serve as critical components to the global financial system, in a way that maintains and extends safety and resilience. These are the topics I will consider today.\n\nChoice and competitionI approach these issues fundamentally as an economist and as a firm believer in the free market. In particular, I would highlight the importance of choice in how markets function and how competition develops. In general, choices encourage competition, leading to better quality products and services. Businesses innovate to differentiate products, including by incorporating new technical capabilities. This improves market responsiveness to consumer demand. Businesses also incorporate new technologies to compete on cost and efficiency. I see stablecoins, for example, as simply another choice available to consumers and businesses, where they have signaled a need in the market to further improve payments.3I believe that we must take this articulated need seriously and respect the ability of the private sector to develop solutions.\n\nThis dynamic is nothing new. Market participants have long had choices in the types of payment instruments they use. Public and private forms of money coexisting, in multiple forms, is in fact a common feature in all developed economies. In the United States, consumers have had central bank money in the form of cash, commercial bank money in the form of deposits in a bank account, and nonbank money (or \"e-money\") in the form of a funds balance on a nonbank payment app. Stablecoins are simply a new form of private money and will exist alongside these other payment instruments, provided consumers accept them as safe, low-risk assets with regulatory protections.4\n\nConsumers and businesses have for decades also had a choice of providers of payment services and financial products including banks, card networks, nonbank payment service providers, and, more recently, other fintechs. Having a choice of providers is important because needs and preferences vary among consumers and businesses. I may choose one provider if I want to park my emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, and I may choose different providers if I want to process a cross-border payment, pay someone with a QR code, or buy a crypto-asset. A choice of providers also encourages competition on cost, speed, efficiency, and user experience.\n\nAdditionally, firms have options for payments and financial infrastructure, which is important because firms might choose to route money or securities on different rails depending on business needs. Some may value speed; some may prefer the ability to batch payments and settle on net to capture liquidity savings. Some will prefer the features of a centralized financial market infrastructure and its built-in regulatory guardrails; some may prefer to transact on public blockchains, with different models for achieving security and integrity. Having multiple options is also good for public policy objectives like promoting resilience across the broader payment system.\n\nAssessing benefits of the next frontier of innovationsGiven this backdrop of new technologies and new entrants within a competitive market, let's explore how this could lead to positive economic outcomes.\n\nFirst, will the next frontier of innovations translate to lower costs? An influx of new market entrants certainly has the potential to drive down costs as they compete for customers, particularly if blockchain-based transactions prove to be cheaper. If stablecoins present a lower cost alternative to consumers and businesses, I am all for it. We are already seeing this dynamic develop outside of the United States, where U.S. dollar stablecoins are an attractive option in countries in which access to dollar banking services is expensive or limited. We also know that cross-border payments, in particular remittances, are relatively expensive. This is attributable in part to the complexity of transactions involving multiple infrastructures, currencies, and intermediaries. One way in which innovative technologies could translate to lower costs is through efficiency gains.\n\nThis brings me to my second question: how might new technologies improve the efficiency of the payment system? Distributed ledger technology, or DLT, is rapidly becoming an efficient infrastructure for 24/7 transactions, recordkeeping, and data management by enabling multiple platforms, parties, assets, and functions to be combined in new ways. As an example, DLT-based platforms can support 24/7 real-time payments and securities transfers by using programmable functionalities like smart contracts to enhance operational efficiency and automate more complex financial transactions. With the ability to specify the precise time at which a transaction settles and under what conditions, DLT-based platforms have the potential to increase the flexibility and efficiency of settlement for money and assets.\n\nMany cross-border payments today rely on the correspondent banking model—a network of bilateral banking relationships that enables financial institutions to access foreign financial systems and to conduct business across jurisdictions without establishing physical and legal presence in every market they serve. While correspondent banking has been the backbone of global payments for decades, this model faces several challenges, including high transaction costs, slower processing times, and a global decline in correspondent banking relationships. While these frictions are attributed in part to the process of sending payments through a complex chain of correspondent banks, I should note that not all frictions are barriers to overcome. Certain frictions are purposely built into the global payment system for compliance and risk-management reasons, such as preventing money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.5\n\nDLT-based platforms have the potential to improve upon the existing correspondent banking model, and private-sector firms are pursuing multiple approaches to do so. One way is through the \"stablecoin sandwich\" model, in which fiat currency in one country is converted first into a stablecoin, then that stablecoin is transferred to another individual, and then converted back into the local fiat currency at its destination. Another way is through the use of tokenized deposits, where banks represent deposit liabilities on a blockchain for wholesale and cross-border transactions. Either model has the potential to improve transparency, cost, and timeliness, while balancing the need for safety and integrity of the transfer. DLT-based platforms generally (and stablecoins, specifically) may also present opportunities for efficiency gains in remittance payments, where today, money transfer operators rely on large global networks of agents and pre-position capital in various currencies to pay out customers in different jurisdictions. These examples also demonstrate that innovation is not an issue of \"TradFi\" versus \"DeFi,\" but rather poses an opportunity to harness the complementary strengths each has to offer, especially at a time where we are seeing increased convergence between the two.\n\nImportantly, efficiency will depend on the extent to which DLT networks can interoperate with one another and with traditional payment rails. This is particularly true because payments exhibit significant network effects. Fortunately, numerous private-sector advances in interoperability are emerging given this market need, and as an operator of core payment and settlement infrastructure, we at the Federal Reserve continue to assess how we can improve our existing rails that serve private-sector firms.\n\nLet's turn from DLT to AI. AI can further improve the efficiency of payments in a number of ways, including through automating manual tasks, detecting fraud or compliance risks, and now with agentic AI, executing tasks on behalf of a person or company quickly and cheaply through the use of AI agents.6Let's again take the example of cross-border payments, which involve multiple jurisdictions, each with its own compliance requirements. Firms are increasingly exploring AI and machine learning (as well as smart contracts) to automate compliance activities.\n\nThird, can new technologies and products maintain and build trust in the digital ecosystem? I believe they can. One common criticism of stablecoins is that they will somehow undermine the trust in money. Under regulatory frameworks like the GENIUS Act in the United States, payment stablecoins will be backed at least 1 to 1 with safe, liquid assets and users will be able to redeem their stablecoins at par. I have long advocated that a right-sized regulatory framework can address concerns related to safety and financial stability, while allowing stablecoins to scale on their own merits.7\n\nAs with any technology, ecosystem operators will need to assess and manage risks, including cybersecurity. As payments shift to new rails and include stablecoins, tokenized assets, and smart contracts, new opportunities for cyberattacks will emerge. Achieving security and resilience means ensuring these digital platforms are hardened against misuse, with redundancy and safeguards in place that match the scale of domestic and global payments. Building resilience requires both the private and public sectors to work together on standards, cybersecurity, and risk management, so that innovation goes hand-in-hand with safety.\n\nRoles of the private and public sectorsThis brings me to the roles that the private and public sectors can play at the next frontier of payments innovation. I often argue that the private sector can most reliably and efficiently allocate resources and take risks to explore the value of new technologies.8The private sector is also best positioned to serve consumers and provide products and services that meet their needs. You don't want the government to decide what technologies are in or out, or decide what consumers want. Further, the private sector brings a depth and level of technical expertise required to translate new technologies into practical improvements for payments.\n\nThe role of the public sector is to support the private sector in specific circumstances where that is useful. At the Federal Reserve, that means serving as a convener to solve coordination problems, providing regulatory clarity when within our specific remit, and operating core payment and settlement infrastructure that the private sector uses. Complementary private and public roles can contribute to a safe and efficient payment system.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe it is important to understand how the Federal Reserve can continue to support private-sector innovation. One way is to conduct research and experimentation on emerging technologies. At the Federal Reserve, we are conducting hands-on research on the latest wave of innovations, including tokenization, smart contracts, and AI in payments. We do this to understand how private-sector innovators will use these to improve payments, as well as identify any opportunities to upgrade our own payment infrastructures.\n\nAnother way is to engage actively with industry on innovations. That is why, in three weeks, I am convening industry leaders and U.S. policymakers to discuss how to further improve the payment system. That is also why I appreciate coming to events like Sibos, where industry experts within the private sector engage with public-sector officials to discuss how we can best navigate the next frontier of innovations.

{"title": "Bowman, Thoughts on Monetary Policy Decisionmaking and Challenges Ahead", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250926a.htm", "author": "Bowman", "subject": "Thoughts on Monetary Policy Decisionmaking and Challenges Ahead", "description": "Speech At the Forecasters Club of New York Luncheon, New York, New York", "category": "Speech", "pub_date": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:00:00 GMT", "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you. I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this distinguished group of macroeconomic forecasters. Today I will discuss how I approach monetary policy decisionmaking, and I will then describe some of the challenges we will likely face in the years ahead.1\n\nBefore turning to the main topic of my remarks, I would like to provide some context about my background and how that shapes my approach to my role as a policymaker. After serving for nearly seven years on the Board of Governors, earlier this year, the President appointed me as the Federal Reserve's Vice Chair for Supervision. My role as a financial regulator and my previous experience as a state bank regulator and community banker in Kansas give me a unique perspective on how to approach my responsibilities as a monetary policymaker. This experience informs how I think about economic conditions and the balance of risks to economic activity, the labor market, and inflation in assessing the appropriate stance and direction of policy.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy that works for all Americans. In doing so, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) conducts its responsibilities according to the congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. The Fed pursues these goals by adjusting its monetary policy stance using a variety of tools, including setting interest rates, providing forward guidance about the expected future path of policy, and adjusting the size and composition of our balance sheet. Our primary monetary policy tool is the federal funds rate, a key interest rate for overnight borrowing by commercial banks that influences other interest rates throughout financial markets. Lower interest rates tend to stimulate demand—for housing, cars and other durable goods, and for business investment—which boosts economic activity and has the potential to push up inflation. Higher interest rates tend to slow the economy and tend to push inflation down.\n\nAchieving both of these goals is challenging when they are in tension. Policy actions to tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal funds rate, can have an adverse effect on employment. By contrast, policy actions aimed at supporting employment that is below its maximum level can potentially increase risks to price stability. These are just a few of the challenges we face as policymakers. With that background, I will share more on my approach to our monetary policy responsibilities and the use of our existing toolkit. I consider my approach in terms of flexibility in shifting the focus on policy objectives when needed and a limited footprint in financial markets.\n\nA Flexible Approach to PolicymakingPursuing the objectives of the dual mandate at the same time means that we generally seek to achieve the maximum level of employment that is consistent with price stability. But the monetary policy objectives are not always complementary. Because our dual mandate places equal weight on both maximum employment and price stability, when these objectives are in tension it is important not to favor one side of the mandate over the other. In that circumstance, we should be flexible and direct our focus to the side of the mandate that deviates the most from its goal or that shows the greater risk of persistently departing from it. Hesitating to address existing or emerging departures from the dual-mandate goals, due to self-limitations stemming from an unwillingness to depart from outdated past policy communication, increases the likelihood that policymakers will need to implement abrupt and large policy corrections.\n\nAs we all remember in 2021, supply and demand imbalances, amplified by extraordinary stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation over just a few months. By the second half of that year, amid growing inflationary pressures, it became clear that our monetary policy stance was too accommodative and that the FOMC needed to move toward a tighter policy stance. On a 12-month basis, total consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose from about 1-1/2 percent in early 2021 to about 9 percent in mid-2022. We began increasing the policy rate at the March 2022 FOMC meeting, when reported CPI inflation was already at about 8 percent and core personal consumption expenditures inflation was above 5 percent.\n\nIn my view, the accommodative forward guidance the Committee adopted in the September and the December 2020 postmeeting statements, which put more weight on the employment side of our mandate, pushed the mandated goals out of balance and contributed to the delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.2That forward guidance made it much more difficult for the FOMC to react to new information suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in response to pandemic-related changes in the economy. This ultimately restricted our ability to respond to rising inflationary pressures before seeing any progress on the labor market. Ultimately, delaying taking appropriate action while inflation started to increase left us in a position in which we needed to course correct and catch up by raising the policy rate in large increments over a number of months.\n\nRecognizing the substantial risk that unacceptably high inflation could persist, and once the conditions in the labor market were moving toward the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, by the end of 2021 I shifted my focus to the inflation side of our mandate and to bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent goal. At the time, I argued in favor of taking prompt and forceful policy action to get inflation under control, which I saw as our primary responsibility at that time, as it had begun to impose a heavy burden on households and businesses. Of course, tightening policy and then maintaining a restrictive stance to lower inflation could have resulted in costs and risks to the labor market, but I saw far greater costs and risks in allowing inflation to persist. And, importantly, maintaining the commitment to restoring price stability is the best course to sustain a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.\n\nAs I noted in recent remarks, we are now facing a very different economic environment.3Over the past several months, I have been pointing to a shift in economic conditions and in the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals, calling attention to signs of potential labor market fragility. And I have argued that increasing signs of weakening labor market conditions provide a basis for proactively supporting the employment side of our mandate.\n\nRecent data show a materially more fragile labor market along with inflation that, excluding tariffs, has continued to hover not far above our target. Given this shift in labor market conditions, at last week's FOMC meeting I supported beginning the process of removing policy restraint and bringing the federal funds rate back to its neutral level.\n\nUp until the July FOMC meeting, even with inflation within range of our target, the Committee has focused primarily on the inflation side of the dual mandate. Now that we have seen many months of deteriorating labor market conditions, it is time for the Committee to act decisively and proactively to address decreasing labor market dynamism and emerging signs of fragility. In my view, the recent data, including the estimated payroll employment benchmark revisions, show that we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions. Should these conditions continue, I am concerned that we will need to adjust policy at a faster pace and to a larger degree going forward.\n\nI recognize and appreciate concerns that we have not yet perfectly achieved our inflation goal. But under a flexible approach to policymaking, it is appropriate to focus on the side of the mandate that is showing signs of deterioration or fragility even though inflation is above but within range of our target. This shift is appropriate now because forecasters widely expect inflation to significantly decline next year, and as further deterioration in labor market conditions would likely lead to more persistent damage to the employment side of the mandate, that would be difficult to address with our tools.\n\nWith tariff-related price increases likely being a one-time effect, my view is that inflation will return to 2 percent after these effects dissipate. Because changes in monetary policy take time to work their way through the economy, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings and therefore remove some policy restraint to avoid weakening in the labor market, provided that long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.\n\nIn addition, putting tariffs aside, the U.S. economy may also be experiencing an extended productivity surge, in large part because of recent technological advances. And productivity growth has likely been higher than reported due to the downward benchmark revisions to payroll gains. These developments reinforce the case for removing policy restraint because monetary policy should accommodate productivity shocks that raise potential output.\n\nIn light of all these considerations, in my view, it was appropriate to begin the process of moving policy toward a more neutral stance at last week's FOMC meeting, and it has been appropriate to do so for several months. Moreover, the rising downside risks to employment and the potential for greater damage to the labor market underscore the need to shift our focus away from overemphasizing the latest data points.\n\nIn the past, I have supported data dependence as an approach that incorporates incoming data into the decisions that lie immediately ahead and further into the future. Our experience during and following the pandemic highlights the difficulty in assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve in the presence of major supply- and demand-side shocks, possible structural changes in the economy, and real-time data and measurement uncertainty. With unusually high uncertainty around the state of the economy and the economic outlook, and with significant risks to our employment and price stability goals, judging where the economy is headed in the future is much more challenging. Therefore, it made sense in the past to consider and be informed by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook in assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy.\n\nBut today we are facing different conditions. I am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase, and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration. An inflexible and dogmatic view of data dependence gives an inherently backward-looking view of the economy and would guarantee that we remain behind the curve, requiring us to catch up in the future.\n\nI think we should consider shifting our focus from overweighting the latest data points to a proactive forward-looking approach and making a forecast that reflects how the economy is likely to evolve going forward. Because policy actions take time to flow through to, or have their full effect on, the economy, labor markets, and inflation, it is important that we are making predictions about where the economy is headed and to act on those forecasts in real time. A forward-looking approach ensures that monetary policy can help support the economy. It also better positions us to avoid falling behind the curve and then having to implement abrupt and dramatic policy actions. In my view, it is more effective to act promptly and decisively in the face of fragility than to be forced to dramatically adjust policy after damage has occurred.\n\nA Limited Footprint – the Fed's Balance SheetI will turn now to discuss my views about how we use our balance sheet. As the runoff in our securities portfolio proceeds following extensive asset purchases during the pandemic, there are several issues with important implications regarding the size and the composition of the Fed's balance sheet in the longer run.\n\nOver the longer run, my preference is to maintain the smallest balance sheet possible with reserve balances at a level closer to scarce than ample. First, a smaller balance sheet would minimize the Fed's footprint in money markets and in Treasury markets. Of course, in order to efficiently implement monetary policy, it is necessary to have some footprint in these markets. Second, holding less-than-ample reserves would return us to a place where we are actively managing our balance sheet, identifying instead of masking signals of market stress. In my view, actively managing our balance sheet would give a more timely indication of stress and market functioning issues, as allowing a modest amount of volatility in money markets can enhance our understanding of market clearing points.\n\nLower levels of reserves may also incentivize banks to engage in more active management of their liquidity positions and liquidity risks. Finally, a lower terminal level of reserves and a smaller balance sheet as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) would provide the FOMC with the optionality to respond to future shocks or economic downturns without worrying whether there is enough room to expand the balance sheet as a potential tool.\n\nIn terms of the composition of the Fed's securities holdings in the longer run, I strongly support having a System Open Market Account portfolio that consists only of Treasury securities to minimize the effects of the Federal Reserve's holdings on the allocation of credit across the economy. Holding agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), or other non-Treasury securities, could be seen as selective credit allocation.\n\nI also look forward to revisiting the Committee's consideration of potential sales of our agency MBS holdings. Simply relying on MBS runoff will not allow returning to a Treasury-only portfolio within a credible time frame.\n\nThe longer-run maturity structure of the Federal Reserve's Treasury securities holdings is also an important consideration. One benefit of a Treasury portfolio maturity structure that mirrors the broader Treasury market is that the Fed's holdings would be \"neutral.\" This means that these holdings would not disproportionately affect the pricing of any given maturity of Treasury security or provide incentives for the issuance of any given type of Treasury security. A balance sheet tilted slightly toward shorter-dated Treasury securities would allow a more flexible approach.\n\nFor example, the FOMC could reduce its shorter-dated Treasury securities holdings in favor of longer-dated Treasury securities if the Committee wanted to use the balance sheet to provide monetary policy accommodation without expanding the size of its securities holdings. This approach would be similar to the FOMC's maturity extension program in 2011 and 2012, sometimes referred to as \"Operation Twist.\" It will be important to consider the potential costs and benefits to the Federal Reserve's Treasury securities maturity structure and the best ways to achieve the desired maturity structure over time.\n\nThe Nature and Use of Emergency ToolsI will turn now to the role for and the availability of policy tools like lending programs and facilities. During periods of extreme financial system stress, the Federal Reserve has the authority, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to use tools, including lending facilities, to directly support the effective functioning of key financial markets and the flow of credit throughout the economy. During the pandemic, the Board extensively relied on the creation of lending programs that were designed to serve as backstops to support market functioning and the flow of credit during times of stress. The temporary nature of these types of lending facilities that are activated only during times of severe financial market stress makes them an attractive alternative to other tools. Lending programs are most effective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short duration. When appropriately calibrated, they can help promote market functioning and the effective transmission of monetary policy but also limit the Federal Reserve's overall footprint in financial markets in the longer term.\n\nDespite their demonstrated effectiveness during times of financial market dysfunction, my view is that emergency lending facilities should be reserved for the single-purpose use in emergency circumstances and should not be institutionalized. In other words, they should not be converted to permanent standing facilities. Instead, they should be activated for only the most exceptionally stressed circumstances. Institutionalizing an activity that was created to temporarily respond to emergency conditions essentially normalizes an extreme emergency response to market illiquidity.\n\nI am concerned that converting emergency facilities created in the depths of a crisis into permanent standing facilities would potentially increase the Fed's footprint in financial markets and have adverse implications, such as distorting private-sector market dynamics and market pricing during normal, noncrisis times. My preference is to rely on these types of facilities only on an emergency basis to address exceptional circumstances. This approach ensures that potential counterparties transact in the private market during times of normal or even mildly stressed market conditions.\n\nA better option would be to announce the short duration of a facility at the time it is created and be clear that it will only exist while the conditions prevail. During the pandemic, we demonstrated the ability to bring these facilities online quickly, so communication reiterating that we stand ready to do it again, even if only on a \"just in time\" basis, may, on its own, have a beneficial effect on market dynamics.\n\nI will conclude this part of my discussion by highlighting a current regulatory proposal that would return the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) to a backstop rather than a binding constraint for bank-affiliated broker-dealers.\n\nTreasury Market IntermediationEven though the U.S. financial system is strong and resilient, over time there have been periods of market stress and volatility in Treasury market intermediation. And there are strong indications that leverage capital requirements may be contributing to vulnerabilities in the Treasury market, particularly in the face of unusually high trading volumes.\n\nIn late June, the Board, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, approved a proposal to modify the eSLR, which applies to the U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Although leverage ratios are intended to serve as a capital \"backstop\" to risk-based measures, the eSLR has become increasingly binding over time. This bindingness has been substantially driven by economic growth, inflation, and the level of reserves in the system. When leverage requirements become a firm's binding capital constraint, they can disincentivize low-risk, low-margin activities. Broker-dealer affiliates of the G-SIBs are significant participants in Treasury market intermediation, and the effect of a more binding eSLR has been to diminish the market intermediation capacity of these intermediaries. This was never the intent of the eSLR. The eSLR proposal would help return this leverage requirement to a more appropriate role as a capital backstop. This important, proactive step would also preserve the role of the eSLR in promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability, and that, as proposed, is also fully consistent with our international agreements.\n\nIn addition, once the GENIUS Act is implemented, stablecoin issuers are required to hold reserves equivalent to the value of stablecoin issuance, which can include U.S. Treasuries.4This additional demand could compound future episodes of Treasury market liquidity stress, increasing the importance of eSLR reform to ensure Treasury market functioning. Once finalized, the eSLR proposal would provide additional balance sheet capacity for G-SIBs to intermediate U.S. Treasury market activities. This change will help build market resilience and reduce the likelihood both of market dysfunction and of the need for the Fed to intervene, by implementing temporary modifications to the eSLR.\n\nReforming the eSLR would also directly address some of the problems that a permanent Federal Reserve facility like the standing repo facility (SRF) is intended to alleviate—for example, mitigating temporary repurchase agreement (repo) rate spikes at month-, quarter-, and year-ends caused by large banks being unwilling to provide a sufficient supply of Treasury market liquidity. In my view, adjusting leverage capital requirements could help refocus the role of the SRF as a liquidity backstop for Treasury market intermediation, rather than normalizing its use and enabling rate arbitrage to drive usage in periods of calm.\n\nAlthough at the July 2021 FOMC meeting I voted to convert ongoing open market operations into a permanent facility, I did so with significant reservations because, as I noted earlier, my preference would be to not institutionalize operations that addressed temporary market emergencies. At that time, I stated that we should have remained attentive to the unintended consequences of an SRF and be prepared to adjust its parameters as needed to address those effects.\n\nIn its current form, the SRF has a minimum bid rate set equal to the discount window primary credit rate, which is also equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. As a result, the SRF, by design, is not fully positioned to serve only as a backstop during times of market dysfunction and stress. My preference would be for a minimum bid rate higher than the top of the federal funds rate target range in order to emphasize that the SRF's purpose is to serve only as a backstop. A rate above the top of the target range would be more likely to discourage use of the facility outside of exceptional market-wide episodes of acute stress. It seems likely that a rate that's not set at a sufficiently high level might still be considered an option for primary dealers experiencing idiosyncratic pressures outside of market-wide disruption. In my view, providing an outlet for dealers that experience these kinds of pressures should not be the intended purpose of this facility.\n\nWhile creating a \"release valve\" to provide greater market liquidity has been a goal of the SRF, I remain concerned that one of its unintended consequences is to distort market signals by artificially affecting repo rate dynamics. It is not the Fed's role to replace or arbitrage private-market activities.\n\nHaving a minimum bid rate on the SRF that is not sufficiently elevated relative to market rates risks suppressing or distorting valuable signals stemming from overnight money markets. While balance sheet runoff is entering a new phase, it is especially important to be able to observe underlying reserve and money market conditions.\n\nChallenges for Monetary Policy AheadThroughout my tenure at the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. economy has experienced many challenging times, including below-target inflation and low unemployment; the effects of the COVID-19 experience, with high unemployment, strong demand enabled by fiscal support, supply chain disruptions, and high inflation; several bank failures; extraordinary immigration; and last year's recalibration of our monetary policy stance. The problems we face are often different and require agility in our understanding of how the economy works and is likely to evolve.\n\nI will turn now to briefly discuss some challenges for monetary policy in the years ahead, including the potential for supply shocks, the transmission of monetary policy to long-term interest rates, the housing market, the artificial intelligence (AI) investment boom, and the ways that I see some of these factors affecting the neutral rate of interest.\n\nSupply ShocksSupply shocks, which move economic activity and inflation in opposite directions, can be challenging for monetary policy to address because they can put the pursuit of the dual-mandate goals in conflict.5The development of new technologies that raise productivity is an example of a positive supply shock that increases potential output, while supply chain disruptions are an example of a negative supply shock. To properly address these shocks, for situations in which the policy objectives are in tension, as implied by the FOMC's revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we need to consider how large and persistent the deviations implied by the shock to the price-stability and maximum-employment mandates will likely be.6Importantly, supply shocks can also affect demand, and so we need to assess how the relative effects on supply and demand are likely to evolve.\n\nTariffs can be seen as a negative shock to the supply of imported goods but can also be viewed as a surcharge on demand for imported goods. Like any surcharge on sales, the effects on inflation are likely short lived, as reduced demand increases slack in the economy and restrains any follow-on price increases, assuming that inflation expectations remain anchored. Therefore, it makes sense for monetary policy to mostly look through the one-off effect on prices and put more weight on the likely more persistent effects on demand and employment.\n\nA step-down in population growth is also a negative supply shock, as it slows the increase in the labor force and output. This development would also represent a negative shock to demand, with the two effects roughly balancing out over time. However, the source of the shock, whether due to lower immigration or the aging of the population, seems relevant. While aging of the population is a gradual process that is less likely to generate sudden deviations in either of our mandates, a shock to immigration can have sharper effects on demand in the near term, as supply is likely to adjust more slowly—for example, housing.\n\nTerm PremiumsA second challenge for monetary policy would be a significant rise in longer-term interest rates driven by higher term premiums, which could offset a reduction in the expectations component stemming from monetary policy easing. This scenario would weaken the transmission of changes in the policy rate to economic activity, as investment decisions of households and businesses are dependent on longer-term rates, such as mortgage rates and corporate bond yields. Although term premiums increased when the FOMC recalibrated the policy stance toward the end of last year, they have come down significantly so far this year, allowing for a reduction in longer-term interest rates.\n\nA further rise in the term premium could reflect higher compensation for expected inflation and increased risks that monetary policy may need to address future shocks to real activity or inflation. Some of the factors that could lead to higher term premiums would be concerns about fiscal sustainability and the FOMC's credibility to achieve its inflation goal.\n\nHousing MarketA third challenge for monetary policy would be a sharp housing market correction. Although supply factors have been weighing down on housing activity for a while, demand factors appear to have recently become the dominant force. Elevated mortgage rates may be exerting a more persistent drag, as income growth expectations have declined while house prices remain high relative to rents. Given very low housing affordability, existing home sales have remained depressed despite higher inventories of homes for sale. I am concerned that declines in house prices could accelerate, posing downside risks to housing wealth and inflation in the years ahead.\n\nArtificial IntelligenceFinally, the surge in AI investment could also be challenging for monetary policy. Investment in new technologies is likely to raise productivity and lower inflation in the medium term. Although the additional investment also boosts demand, the effects on productivity and supply are likely to occur relatively quickly, and the economy is less likely to tighten appreciably in the near term. In this case, monetary policy should refrain from restraining aggregate demand, as any deviation from maximum employment is likely to be temporary.\n\nThere is a risk that expectations of returns on these high-tech investments may be too optimistic and raise financial stability concerns. Although tech companies can largely self finance these investments, or easily access bond and equity markets, if expectations of future revenues do not materialize, we may see a large correction in equity markets and a slump in investment spending due to over-capacity. Such a correction would lead to a contraction in aggregate demand through lower household wealth and lower expected profits.\n\nNeutral Rate of InterestSome of the factors discussed here may be key influences on the neutral interest rate, or r*. The two factors that I am more attentive to are slower population growth and fiscal sustainability risks. Although these factors have opposite effects on the balance between savings and investment and r*, I see slower population growth and the aging of the population as more prominent factors in pulling down the neutral interest rate. If fiscal sustainability concerns are not addressed in the years ahead, by stabilizing or reversing the upward trajectory of the federal debt-to-GDP ratio, I am afraid that r* and interest rates could rise and crowd out private investment.\n\nClosing ThoughtsBefore we move on to the discussion, I'd like to touch on the supervision and regulatory work under way. We have made a lot of progress in the past few months since I became the Vice Chair for Supervision. And Congress has been hard at work considering important banking and digital assets legislation and the passage of the GENIUS Act.\n\nIn addition to working to implement the Fed's responsibilities under this law, we are making significant progress on a number of priorities in supervision and regulation. Early in my tenure, I described my approach to take a fresh look at our supervision and regulatory framework.7\n\nWe have made progress on a wide range of priorities in these past few months, including\n\nWhile we are making progress in a number of areas, there is much left to do. Some of this work will include improving the mergers and acquisitions process; reviewing the appropriateness of capital requirements for all banks, including revising the community bank leverage ratio and approaches for mutual banks; and addressing payments and check fraud. We are continuing to enhance examiner training and development, and we will continue to prioritize economic growth and safety and soundness in the bank regulatory framework.\n\nThank you again for the invitation to join you today. It's a pleasure to be here, and I look forward to our discussion.\n\n1.

{"title": "Barr, Preserving the Dynamism and Credibility of Stress Testing", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250925a.htm", "author": "Barr", "subject": "Preserving the Dynamism and Credibility of Stress Testing", "description": "Speech At the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C.", "category": "Speech", "pub_date": "Thu, 25 Sep 2025 17:00:00 GMT", "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you.1\n\nToday, I would like to discuss a vital tool for supervising the safety and soundness of the largest banks and preserving the stability of our financial system. I was there, at the Treasury Department in 2009, when stress testing was first used in the United States in the heat of battle, an ad hoc measure to reverse a loss of confidence in U.S. banks that was a major force then driving the Great Recession. By examining how the balance sheets of banks would be affected by a worsening of financial and economic conditions, this process was intended to reveal weaknesses that could threaten the solvency of banks and prevent them from playing their central role in the economy.2\n\nStress testing ultimately succeeded in helping to restore confidence during the crisis, and in the aftermath this battle-tested tool became a formal and integral part of the effort to repair the ensuing damage and strengthen the banking system. Stress testing has continued to evolve in the years since then to maintain that strength and help limit the chances of another devastating financial crisis. Stress testing changed as its purpose changed from wartime to peacetime—from mitigating the crisis to preserving safety, soundness, and stability. It has changed as banks and regulators learned more about how stress testing works in practice and as part of an otherwise evolving supervisory and regulatory framework for banks that must necessarily adjust as finance itself evolves.\n\nAdjusting regulation in this dynamic environment is challenging, and one of those challenges is dealing with unintended consequences. The Federal Reserve made changes to stress testing in 2020 intended to make it more predictable and to better integrate it with overall capital regulation, but those changes are now at the center of litigation brought by large banks. The Fed responded in April by proposing more changes intended to address these criticisms. But as I explained in voting against those measures, I believe these steps will substantially impair stress testing, concealing rather than revealing crucial weaknesses in the risk management of individual banks and in the stability of the financial system.3As the Federal Reserve Board considers these changes, I believe we should focus on how best to address the original purpose—and preserve the effectiveness—of stress testing. As I will explain, I believe that the best way to further these goals is to separate stress testing from capital requirements in order to maximize the informative value of the tests and their results and untangle them from the larger and complex task of setting capital requirements. I will lay out that alternative approach toward the end of these remarks, but first I believe it is helpful to take a step back and recall how stress testing has evolved to this point, then turn to where it should go from here.\n\nIt all began during the Global Financial Crisis. Capital markets froze, resulting in business failures and prompting the need for unprecedented public-sector intervention. Credit to households and businesses slowed to a trickle, and millions of people were losing homes and jobs. By the fall of 2008, there was a broad-based lack of confidence in the banking system, as large banks faced questions about their exposures to losses related to real estate and other assets. These were questions that large banks in many cases couldn't credibly answer because of the complexity and opacity of their direct and indirect exposures to mortgages at the center of the crisis. Without this information, investors assumed the worst, driving down equity prices of banks, which complicated efforts by banks to bolster their balance sheets.\n\nRestoring confidence in the banking system required credible information from a reliable source. Treasury worked with the Federal Reserve to design the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) to test the capital adequacy of what were determined to be the 19 most systemically important banking and financial institutions. In addition, Congress had provided a backstop in the form of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had backstopped bank funding through guarantees, and the Federal Reserve had stepped up in significant ways to bolster the financial system and the economy. The existence of a government backstop played a big role in the success of the first stress test. With the use of public funding on the line, the rigor and transparency of the stress test was doubly important.4\n\nRebuilding Confidence in the Largest BanksThere were five aspects of the SCAP that are elemental to stress testing and have been present in the different tests since then.\n\nFirst, there was the use of a severe but plausible scenario for macroeconomic conditions. The scenario assumed a deeper and more prolonged recession than forecasters expected. Because of the focus on housing-related losses, the scenario's assumption of a further severe decline in housing prices was essential to rebuilding confidence.\n\nSecond, there was the use of economic models to translate a given scenario into quantified losses for each bank. The banking regulators worked together to develop models to map the stress scenario into a range of associated loss rates for different loan categories and iterated with the banks to assess their specific exposures.\n\nThird, based on the extent of those projected losses, the test arrived at a firm-specific amount of capital that each bank would need in order to withstand this stress and keep lending to customers.\n\nA fourth aspect of the SCAP and subsequent stress tests was the public disclosure of the scenario, the basic testing methodology, and, most importantly, firm-specific results.\n\nAnd lastly, in addition to the balance sheet data and other numbers related to the stress test, the Federal Reserve produced a qualitative supervisory assessment of the banks' capital planning decisions and processes.\n\nOne essential element of that first test is that the supervisors reviewed and assessed the data and modeling assumptions used by the banks, which helped to provide credibility for the loss estimates. The result of the SCAP was that 10 of the 19 tested institutions were required to raise capital sufficient to keep them above regulatory minimums if the scenario were to materialize—a total of $75 billion. The 10 were given six months to develop capital plans to meet their stress test minimums.\n\nThe SCAP was remarkably successful. There was skepticism that the test would be sufficiently severe or transparent to be credible, and bank stock prices were volatile due to speculation about what the stress test results would reveal. But bank stocks recovered after the results were announced in May. Most banks that had been struggling to raise capital were able to do so, with 9 of the 10 able to find private sector sources of funding by the six-month deadline.5Credit default swaps for large banks returned to levels seen before the acute stage of the crisis.6Bank lending was slower to recover, but stabilizing the banks helped stop the crisis and the U.S. economy started the long process of recovery that July.\n\nSupporting the Resilience of the Largest BanksI have compared the SCAP to a battlefield campaign, and while the financial crisis certainly felt like combat at the time, my point is to emphasize the unique challenge of making financial regulatory policy in an emergency. The goal was to restore public trust in banks that were under fire, and as the job shifted to preserving that trust, it was apparent that there should be an ongoing role for stress testing in peacetime as well. Starting with the yearly stress test established in 2010 with the Dodd-Frank Act and continuing with the integration of stress testing into the Federal Reserve's annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the peacetime approach focused on institutionalizing bank resilience and risk-management practices. The Federal Reserve Board conducted the first CCAR exercise in 2011. CCAR was an overall assessment of the capital planning processes of banks, which included quantitative and qualitative components. Either of those components could form the basis for an objection by the Fed to firm plans to distribute capital to shareholders, distribution which would reduce the capital available that the firm could use to buffer its losses.\n\nThe quantitative evaluation of a firm's capital adequacy was driven by the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test, or DFAST.7It departed from the SCAP in at least two important ways. First, rather than making the severe scenario just a more negative version of the current consensus forecast, the Fed built a process to develop thematic forward-looking scenarios using macroeconomic models calibrated to historical data.8Some parts of the scenario design framework are purposely countercyclical under normal conditions—for instance, the minimum peak unemployment rate is set at 10 percent. The countercyclicality of stress test scenarios is an attempt to lean against pro-cyclical effects that can make borrowers appear overly resilient in good times, something which could cause the model to significantly understate the magnitude of borrower defaults when the economy turns.9\n\nThe second way that the Dodd-Frank stress test departed from CCAR is that most losses under DFAST are projected by applying models developed and operated by the Federal Reserve based on data provided by the banks. Using Fed-developed and validated models provides for independent risk assessments. The granular data provided by banks has been valuable in ensuring that the stress tests are truly risk sensitive and in understanding broader trends and interconnections in the financial system.\n\nIn addition to this quantitative test, CCAR assesses the ability of banks to determine their capital needs in the future. Supplementing the DFAST model administered by the Fed, each bank projects its income over the stress scenario using its internal models, providing supervisors with a view of governance and risk management of the bank's capital planning process. If a bank did not pass either the quantitative or qualitative evaluation, the Board of Governors was able to object to the capital plan and restrict the firm's shareholder distributions.\n\nOver time, several criticisms of CCAR's approach emerged. The first was that CCAR was wholly separate from the process used to set a bank's basic, risk-based capital requirements. Large banks also criticized CCAR for a lack of transparency and predictability that resulted in them pre-committing to lower capital distributions and higher levels of capital.\n\nIn 2020, the Federal Reserve Board addressed these bank criticisms by creating the stress capital buffer (SCB). To address the criticism that CCAR was additive and wasn't integrated into capital planning, the SCB combined the basic capital requirement for banks with one equal to a bank's projected capital ratio decline during the stress test plus a year's worth of planned dividends, linking components of the capital framework. To address the claim that CCAR lacked transparency and predictability, the SCB requirement was set for each participating bank at a level that reflected its losses in the stress test and provided banks with flexibility to change their dividends in real time.10\n\nAnother bank criticism was that CCAR's use of a qualitative assessment was subjective. The SCB dropped the qualitative objection and recast the assessment of capital planning practices as a traditional supervisory exam.\n\nBy more directly integrating stress testing into capital regulation, the SCB increasingly moved stress testing away from supervision and toward the regulatory arena, a consequential decision. While this change was intended to promote consistency and predictability, in retrospect, it may have reduced some of the value of the exercise, in that it reduced the range of facts and circumstances the Board would take into account when evaluating an individual firm's capital adequacy. As a result, the Board's flexibility to adjust capital adequacy determinations based on the unique features of different firms, including different business models and risk profiles, was constrained.\n\nWhen I became Vice Chair for Supervision in 2022, we continued the process of evolving the stress test as necessary. In particular, the Fed conducted multiple scenarios not directly connected to setting banks' capital requirements.11Using additional scenarios has helped us to understand how a broader range of risks might affect the banking system. For example, we've explored a stagflation scenario and looked at the failures of large non-bank counterparties. Using multiple scenarios has helped to keep our risk-assessments dynamic.\n\nBenefits and Effects of the Current Stress Testing FrameworkBefore turning to the legal challenges of the current stress test framework, I would be remiss not to emphasize the value of that framework. The stress test has been a critical element that led to strengthening both the quantity of capital in the banking system and the risk-management capabilities of large banks.\n\nSince the Global Financial Crisis, large banks have more than doubled their risk-based common equity capital ratios—from roughly 5 percent to 12 percent or more. At the same time, they have made meaningful improvements in their ability to measure, monitor, and manage their own risks. The stress test has directly contributed to both.\n\nDespite this success, some have argued for what they term \"full transparency\" of the test. But the criticism can be misleading because two important points are often omitted. First, the Federal Reserve already provides substantial information about the design of the test and has expanded those disclosures over time. Banks are far from uninformed. They receive substantial information about the models in annual model methodology disclosures.12Any material model changes are phased in over two years, with full explanation. Second, what critics call \"transparency\" is not disclosure of basic information about the rigor and methodology of the test essential for its credibility; instead, it is the equivalent of handing out the questions to the test in advance. That would fundamentally undermine the rigor of the test, which is intended to assess resilience under conditions not fully known in advance, just as in a financial crisis.\n\nIn short, the framework strikes a deliberate balance: providing banks with enough information about scenarios and models to ensure fairness and accountability, while preserving the rigor that makes the stress test an effective safeguard.\n\nChallenges to the Current Stress Testing FrameworkIn December 2024, bank trade associations brought suit against the Board of Governors, challenging the role of stress testing in setting SCB requirements for large firms. The trade associations have challenged what they contend is the opacity of certain elements of the stress testing process and have argued that the models and scenarios should be released in proposed form to promote transparency and facilitate public comment. In anticipation of, and in response to, this litigation, the Board announced that it would disclose and seek public comment on all of the models that determine the hypothetical losses and revenue of banks under stress, as well as the annual stress scenarios. The Board also proposed to change its rules to average stress testing results over two years to reduce the year-over-year volatility in the capital requirements that result from annual stress testing.\n\nThese proposed changes represent a policy choice to respond to the litigation by enhancing transparency and promoting public participation, and they are not intended to materially affect overall capital requirements. But in my judgment, they are a mistake that will make stress testing less rigorous and nimble.\n\nSubjecting the stress testing models to the notice and comment process could lead them to ossify, and their dynamism and effectiveness may fade. Stress testing models are inherently complex and require adjustments to maintain accuracy and relevance to appropriately account for quickly developing risks. Changes in the models would require new notice and solicitation of comment, and the time lag and burden in making changes would be significantly extended. We saw this type of ossification play out before the Global Financial Crisis, when supervisory stress testing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became formulaic and failed to capture escalating risks, with dire consequences.13\n\nAn additional problem is that the comment process may have an uneven effect, since banks have an incentive to object to aspects of the models that result in higher capital requirements and not to highlight the areas in which the models underestimate downside risk. Responding to these comments could create a one-way ratchet that successively weakens capital requirements.\n\nKnowing the details of the stress test in advance will also increase the likelihood that banks are able to game the results to lower their capital requirements. We have seen examples of how firms have been able to game stress tests. For instance, some firms started to use so-called \"macro hedges\" in the late 2010s. Many of these macro hedges were hedges against a deep recession, similar to a stress test scenario, and these short-term hedges were cheap because investors assessed these scenarios as extremely unlikely (they were far \"out of the money\" in option terms). The hedges reduced projected capital losses in the stress tests by billions of dollars for some banks. But they weren't credible protection from the effects of a recession because maintaining these hedges would become prohibitively expensive as the economy moved into an actual downturn. This is just one example of attempts to game the stress tests, that were eventually addressed through the supervisory process. But this example underscores how full disclosure of the Fed's stress models and scenarios would enable banks to optimize stress test results by, among other things, adjusting their balance sheets based on their knowledge of where the models underprice risk, in order to reduce their capital requirements without materially reducing risks.\n\nBanks are likely to change their behavior in other ways that increase risk. Banks may invest less in their own risk management if the test becomes too predictable. Full disclosure of the Board's models may encourage concentration across the banking system in assets that receive comparably lighter treatment in the test, which could create risks to financial stability. And banks are likely to reduce their management buffers, making it more likely that they would breach their required buffers and minimums in the event of stress. The upshot is that a full-transparency stress testing regime can increase systemic risks because risk is underestimated and capital is too low. The stress tests could lose their credibility. A loss in credibility is bad for the banks, the banking system, financial stability and, ultimately, American families and businesses.\n\nAn Alternative Path ForwardAs an alternative to these proposed changes, I would favor prioritizing the rigor of the stress testing framework by separating stress testing from binding regulatory capital requirements, which would instead be increased commensurately.14The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the Board conduct stress tests on large banks \"to evaluate whether such companies have the capital, on a total consolidated basis, necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions.\"15While these results can and should still play a role in informing supervisory and management assessments of the appropriate capital level for particular banking organizations, decoupling the stress test results from the preliminary SCB would enable the Board to preserve essential aspects of stress testing, including the generation of credible and detailed information on the risk exposures of banks and how their capital levels would be affected by a stress event. Such information would be valuable in the supervision of banks in normal times and especially important if banks and the financial system are again threatened by crisis.\n\nIf the stress tests are no longer used to inform the calculation of a firm's preliminary SCB requirement, the legal justification for publishing the models and scenarios for comment would be eliminated, and I've already discussed the policy grounds for not publishing them. So, the Board could abandon the notice and comment proposal.\n\nThe Board could approach these statutorily required tests primarily as a supervisory exercise and could thereby retain flexibility to design and adjust the models and scenarios as appropriate to ensure their rigor and robustness. Moreover, as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board could run multiple scenarios to provide greater dimension to the assessment of risks.16As history teaches us, shocks and crises can manifest through a range of channels, and testing a large bank's unique profile under a range of risks is more likely to yield high-value information about a bank's likely resilience to potential stress events. The net result of these changes would be to increase the nimbleness, dynamism, and effectiveness of our current stress testing framework. The Board's continued publication of firm-specific results would promote transparency and market discipline.\n\nSo that this change does not reduce overall capital in the system, SCBs could instead be set entirely by regulation. For most non-G-SIBs subject to the SCB requirement, the current 2.5 percent buffer floor likely remains an appropriate level. For G-SIBs with a lot of trading, past stress tests have routinely indicated that SCBs should likely be set higher than the 2.5 percent floor, and any regulatory capital measure designed to replace the current SCB framework would need to account for this gap. While further analytical work is required, the shortfall generated by decoupling the stress tests from the SCB may be largely addressed by a regulatory capital requirement linked to the risks in the trading book, with perhaps some other adjustments as required to maintain appropriate capital levels. If, over time, stress testing results indicate that this replacement regulatory capital measure routinely exceeds or falls short of the capital levels required to provide adequate resilience to stress conditions, the Board could revise the regulatory measure through a notice-and-comment process, informed by data gathered in the stress testing process.\n\nThis proposed approach of decoupling the stress tests from regulatory capital and increasing regulatory capital to make up the shortfall in the SCB appears to me to be the best way to retain the value of stress testing as a supervisory exercise while maintaining appropriate levels of capital in the system. However, replacing the current framework of individualized SCBs—informed by firm-specific stress test results—with broadly applicable, formulaic regulatory capital requirements would result in a diminution of the risk sensitivity reflected in SCB requirements. That is, capital levels for firms that are subject to the stress tests would be relatively less tailored than they currently are and less reflective of the unique business models, exposures, and risk profiles of a particular firm.\n\nTo address this loss in risk sensitivity, I would propose that, in exceptional circumstances, the Board could use its capital directive authority to impose individualized capital requirements on specific firms to account for a firm's particular circumstances, including its capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, and other appropriate risk-related factors.17This would be similar to the United Kingdom's Pillar II-B requirements and those of other jurisdictions.18While these requirements could be informed by the stress test results in part, they would also take into account qualitative factors and supervisory judgment. Because these individualized requirements would consider the specific risks of a firm, they would be adjusted to reflect a specific firm's risk profile. While I don't believe it would be advisable for this type of exercise to become the default manner for setting capital requirements, in exceptional cases, it would preserve some of the tailoring benefits of the current SCB regime in a manner that comports with the changes I have discussed. Furthermore, it would preserve the ability for the Board to address stress results that demonstrate significant deficiencies in capital adequacy under a stressed scenario, when the firms are otherwise in compliance with regulatory capital requirements.\n\nWith these changes, stress testing could maintain its flexibility and adaptability and therefore could retain its value as an effective tool for identifying idiosyncratic risk in a major bank and ensuring that capital is sufficient to address the risk. Among the benefits would be the space this approach would allow for continued innovation in stress testing. Such innovation is vital as finance evolves and banks continue to seek ways to reduce supervisory and regulatory requirements. This approach could allow for scenario design and modeling advancements unencumbered by the limitations I've spoken of imposed by the notice-and-comment process.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe it is critical to maintain the dynamism and rigor of stress testing so that supervisors, banks, and the public understand the underlying vulnerabilities in the banking system and at the largest banks and understand that these firms are holding sufficient capital to address these vulnerabilities. I have deep concerns that the set of changes the Board is now considering risks reliance on a stress test that can no longer effectively assess the resilience of the largest banks and lacks credibility, thus putting our financial system and economy at risk.\n\n1.

It is a pleasure to be back here in Rhode Island. The last time I had the opportunity to speak to the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce was in the fall of 2019. I noted then that, \"if the outlook changes materially, policy will change as well.\"1\n\nLittle did any of us know! Just a couple of months later, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. Both the economy and our policy evolved dramatically in ways no one could have predicted. Along with actions by Congress, the Administration, and the private sector, the Fed's aggressive response helped stave off historically severe downside risks to the economy.\n\nThe COVID pandemic came on the heels of the painfully slow decade-long recovery from the Global Financial Crisis. These two back-to-back world historical crises have left behind scars that will be with us for a long time. In democracies around the world, public trust in economic and political institutions has been challenged. Those of us who are in public service at this time need to focus tightly on carrying out our critical missions to the best of our ability in the midst of stormy seas and powerful crosswinds.\n\nThroughout this turbulent period, central banks like the Fed have had to develop innovative new policies that were designed to deliver on our statutory goals during times of crisis, rather than for everyday use. Despite these two unique, extremely large shocks, the U.S. economy has performed as well or better than other large, advanced economies around the world. As always, it is essential that we continue to look back and learn the right lessons from these difficult years, and that process has been ongoing for more than a decade.\n\nTurning to the present day, the U.S. economy is showing resilience in the midst of substantial changes in trade and immigration policies, as well as in fiscal, regulatory and geopolitical arenas. These policies are still emerging, and their longer-term implications will take some time to be seen.\n\nEconomic OutlookRecent data show that the pace of economic growth has moderated. The unemployment rate is low but has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and the downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In recent months, it has become clear that the balance of risks has shifted, prompting us to move our policy stance closer to neutral at our meeting last week.\n\nGDP rose at a pace of around one and a half percent in the first half of the year, down from 2.5 percent growth last year. The moderation in growth largely reflects a slowdown in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector remains weak, but business investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from last year's pace. As noted in the September Beige Book, a report that gathers qualitative information from across the Fed System, businesses continue to say that uncertainty is weighing on their outlook. Measures of consumer and business sentiment declined sharply in the spring; they have since moved up but remain low relative to the start of the year.\n\nIn the labor market, there has been a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers—an unusual and challenging development. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment have risen. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but has remained relatively stable at a low level over the past year. Payroll job gains slowed sharply over the summer months, as employers added an average of just 29,000 per month over the past three months. The recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the \"breakeven\" rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. But a number of other labor market indicators remain broadly stable. For example, the ratio of job openings to unemployment remains near 1. And multiple measures of job openings have been moving roughly sideways, as have initial claims for unemployment insurance.\n\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs of 2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. The latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, up from 2.3 percent in August 2024. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent last month, also higher than the year-ago level. Goods prices, after falling last year, are driving the pickup in inflation. Incoming data and surveys suggest that those price increases largely reflect higher tariffs rather than broader price pressures. Disinflation for services continues, including for housing. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.\n\nThe overall economic effects of the significant changes in trade, immigration, fiscal and regulatory policy remain to be seen. A reasonable base case is that the tariff-related effects on inflation will be relatively short lived—a one-time shift in the price level. A \"one-time\" increase does not mean \"all at once.\" Tariff increases will likely take some time to work their way through supply chains. As a result, this one-time increase in the price level will likely be spread over several quarters and show up as somewhat higher inflation during that period.\n\nBut uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high. We will carefully assess and manage the risk of higher and more persistent inflation. We will make sure that this one-time increase in prices does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\n\nMonetary PolicyNear-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside—a challenging situation. Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path. If we ease too aggressively, we could leave the inflation job unfinished and need to reverse course later to fully restore 2 percent inflation. If we maintain restrictive policy too long, the labor market could soften unnecessarily. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate.\n\nThe increased downside risks to employment have shifted the balance of risks to achieving our goals. We therefore judged it appropriate at our last meeting to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance, lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 to 4-1/4 percent. This policy stance, which I see as still modestly restrictive, leaves us well positioned to respond to potential economic developments.\n\nOur policy is not on a preset course. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment and bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.\n\nThank you again for having me here. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n1. See Jerome H.

Earlier this year, the President nominated, and the Senate confirmed, me as the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision. It's the first time someone with community banking experience has served in this role, and I am working to make sure that the Federal Reserve is addressing the issues I have discussed with you and other community bankers over the past nearly seven years that I've been a member of the Board of Governors.\n\nIt is really a pleasure to be with you again, and especially in Asheville, North Carolina, after the terrible flooding this area experienced last year.\n\nSince the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met for our September meeting last week, I thought I would share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy, including on my policy vote.\n\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC MeetingAt last week's FOMC meeting, the Committee voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 4 to 4-1/4 percent, and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. In my view, the Committee should have begun lowering the policy rate at the July meeting, so, of course, I supported reducing the policy rate at this meeting.\n\nFor several months, I have been pointing out signs of potential labor market fragility. Since the June FOMC meeting and in public remarks following that meeting, I have argued that increasing signs of weakening labor market conditions provide a basis for beginning to move the policy rate closer to neutral to proactively support the employment side of our mandate. Recent data have revealed a materially more fragile labor market along with inflation that, excluding tariffs, has continued to hover not far above our target. Given this shift in labor market conditions, I am pleased that we have finally begun the process of removing policy restraint, reflecting the economic conditions and the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals. Assuming the economy evolves as I expect, last week's action should be the first step to bring the federal funds rate back to its neutral level.\n\nEconomic Conditions and OutlookThe U.S. economy has been resilient, but I am concerned about the weakening in labor market conditions and softer economic growth. I am also more confident that, as trade policy has become more certain, tariffs will have only a small and short-lived effect on inflation going forward.\n\nGDP growth slowed to a modest pace in the first half of the year, as consumer spending softened and both investment in residential and commercial real estate and federal government purchases declined. A surge in high-tech investment, likely related to interest-rate-insensitive AI and data-center projects, accounted for at least half of the increased demand in the first six months of the year, while there was weakness in other categories. The incoming data for July and August point to an improvement in third-quarter consumer expenditures.\n\nDeclines in housing activity, including single-family home construction and sales, have been accompanied by higher inventories of homes for sale and falling house prices, suggesting that housing demand has also weakened. Elevated mortgage rates may be exerting a more persistent drag as income growth expectations have declined while house prices remain high relative to rents. Given very low housing affordability, existing home sales have remained depressed since 2023 and at levels only comparable with the early 2010s following the financial crisis. I am concerned that, in the current environment, declines in house prices could accelerate, posing downside risks to housing valuations, construction, and inflation.\n\nTurning to the labor market, conditions have weakened this year as shown by the rise in the unemployment rate and essentially flat payroll employment, which rose only about 25,000 per month since April. This is down sharply from the moderate pace of job gains seen earlier in the year and well below estimates of breakeven rates, due to softening in labor demand. The unemployment rate moved up to 4.3 percent in August, largely reflecting reduced hiring as businesses continue to retain existing workers instead of increasing layoffs. Wage growth has slowed closer to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation, indicating that the labor market is no longer a source of inflation pressures.\n\nAlthough still near full employment, the labor market has become more fragile and could deteriorate more significantly in the coming months. The unemployment rate has increased notably among groups that tend to be more affected by the business cycle, including teenagers. And the employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly this year, showing more softening than the unemployment rate implies. Layoffs have edged up from low levels and could rise quickly if the economy weakens further since hiring rates have remained low. One consequence of a less dynamic labor market this year is the significant increase in the number of long-term unemployed workers.\n\nPayroll employment growth has been concentrated in just a few services industries that tend to be less affected by the business cycle, with healthcare, social services, and leisure and hospitality more than accounting for all job gains since April. The share of industries with positive job growth over the last six months dropped below 50 percent in August to a historically low level.\n\nActual payroll employment may have started to fall in recent months given the sizable upward bias in the published data implied by the Q1 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report. Although less immigration likely explains some of the slower payroll gains and economic growth this year, immigration does not fully explain the slowing. The surge in immigration likely boosted the rise in unemployment through mid-2024, and lower immigration may now be masking a steeper rise in unemployment this year. In addition, these immigrants likely make a smaller contribution to economic activity than the average U.S. worker, as they tend to work in jobs and industries with lower wages and lower productivity.2\n\nOn price stability, we have seen some progress in lowering inflation, excluding one-off tariff effects on goods prices. Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12‑month core PCE inflation likely stood at 2.9 percent in August. However, after removing estimated tariff effects, core PCE inflation has hovered around 2.5 percent in recent months, which is significant progress and within range of our target. This progress reflects a considerable slowing in core services inflation, which is consistent with recent softness in consumer spending and the labor market no longer being a source of inflation pressures.\n\nThe underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently shown in the data. With housing services inflation on a sustained downward trajectory, and further progress on other categories within core services inflation, only core goods inflation remains elevated, likely reflecting limited pass-through from tariffs.\n\nIn terms of risks to achieving our dual mandate, as I gain even greater confidence that tariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation, I see that upside risks to price stability have diminished. With softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should focus on risks to our employment mandate and preemptively stabilize and support labor market conditions.\n\nMemories of pandemic worker shortages are still fresh, and businesses have so far chosen to maintain, rather than to reduce, their workforce in response to the slowing economic conditions. They also seem to be more willing to reduce profit margins as they are less able to fully pass through higher costs and raise prices given the weakness in demand. If demand conditions do not improve, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it will not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.\n\nOn trade policy, foreign suppliers are absorbing some of the new tariffs, and importers are shifting to lower-tariffed sources. Slack in the economy should also allow for only limited one-time price effects this year and very little, if any, \"second round\" effects on inflation in the medium term. I expect that lower immigration will continue to lessen demand and reduce inflation, especially on housing services. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment are likely to boost supply and offset any tariff-related effects on economic activity and prices over the medium term.\n\nThe Policy Decision and the Path ForwardSo far this year, even with inflation within range of our target, the Committee has focused primarily on the inflation side of the dual mandate. Now that we have seen many months of deteriorating labor market conditions, it is time for the Committee to act decisively and proactively to address decreasing labor market dynamism and emerging signs of fragility. In my view, the recent data, including the estimated payroll employment benchmark revisions, show that we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions. Should these conditions continue, I am concerned that we will need to adjust policy at a faster pace and to a larger degree going forward.\n\nI recognize and appreciate concerns that we have not yet perfectly achieved our inflation goal. Because our dual mandate places equal weights on the two goals, we should turn our focus toward the side of the mandate that is showing signs of deterioration or fragility even though inflation is above but within range of our target. This should be especially the case since forecasters widely expect inflation to significantly decline next year, and as further deterioration in labor market conditions would likely lead to more persistent damage to the employment side of the mandate that would be difficult to address with our tools.\n\nIn my role as monetary policymaker, I am agnostic about why shocks happen, I take conditions as they are, and I make monetary policy decisions to support the economy. The credibility and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve depend on the public's trust that we will not bring a value judgment into our assessment of the underlying conditions.\n\nEconomic research is clear that, when conditions exist like those we are currently facing, monetary policy should de-emphasize inflation. The U.S. economy is experiencing aspects of a negative supply shock from higher tariffs that is also affecting aggregate demand. Since these conditions are unlikely to lead to persistent effects on inflation, and because changes in monetary policy take time to work their way through the economy, optimal policy calls for looking through temporarily elevated inflation readings. Therefore, we should proactively remove some policy restraint on aggregate demand to avoid damage to the labor market and a further weakening in the economy, provided that long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.\n\nIn addition, putting tariffs aside, the U.S. economy may also be experiencing an extended productivity surge, in large part because of recent technological advances. And productivity growth has likely been higher than reported due to the downward benchmark revisions to payroll gains. These developments reinforce the case for removing policy restraint because monetary policy should accommodate productivity shocks that raise potential output.\n\nIn light of all these considerations, in my view, it was appropriate to begin the process of moving policy toward a more neutral stance at this meeting, and it has been for several months. In thinking about the path forward, I supported revising the characterization of the policy outlook in the post-meeting statement. It is important we signal that last week's action includes a forward-looking view of additional adjustments. If the statement had not included a reference to additional cuts, it would have signaled to markets that the Committee would not be responsive to weakening labor market conditions.\n\nI am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration. Characterizing an appropriate forward-looking view of additional policy adjustments is important because it shapes the expected path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, affects longer-term interest rates, including mortgage and corporate bond rates, that are key for household and business decisionmaking. Cutting the policy rate 25 basis points and signaling additional adjustments at upcoming meetings should allow longer-term interest rates to remain materially lower than earlier this year and help to support the economy.\n\nFinally, I should note that the rising downside risks to employment and the potential for greater damage to the labor market underscore the need to shift our focus away from overemphasizing the latest data points. A strict interpretation of data dependence is inherently backward looking and would guarantee that we remain behind the curve, requiring us to overcorrect in the future. I think we should consider reframing our focus from overweighing the latest data to a proactive forward-looking approach and a forecast that reflects how the economy is likely to evolve going forward. This approach would better position us to avoid falling behind the curve and then having to implement abrupt and dramatic policy actions.\n\nDuring this intermeeting period, I will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data and information as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve. Before our next meeting in October, we will have received one additional month of employment and inflation data. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance going forward.\n\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on each of our assessments of the incoming data and the implications for risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nClosing ThoughtsBefore we move on to the discussion, I'd like to touch on the supervision and regulatory work underway. We have made a lot of progress in the past few months since I officially became the Vice Chair for Supervision. And Congress has been hard at work considering important banking and digital assets legislation and the passage of the GENIUS Act.3\n\nIn addition to working to implement the Fed's responsibilities under this law, we are making significant progress on a number of priorities in supervision and regulation. Early in my tenure, I described my approach that would require taking a fresh look at our activities.4\n\nWhile we are making progress in a number of areas, there is much left to do. Some of this work will include improving the M&A process; reviewing the appropriateness of capital requirements for all banks, including revising the community bank leverage ratio and approaches for mutual banks; and addressing payments and check fraud (our request for information comment period ended last week). We are continuing to enhance examiner training and development, and we will continue to prioritize economic growth and safety and soundness in the bank regulatory framework. I look forward to sharing details with you during our discussion.\n\nThank you again for the invitation to join you today. It's a pleasure to spend time with our nation's community bankers.\n\n1.

As such, I would like to be transparent on my thinking. Subsequent to last week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), it should be clear that my view of appropriate monetary policy diverges from those of other FOMC members; I view policy as very restrictive, believe it poses material risks to the Fed's employment mandate, and would like to explain why.\n\nThere's no perfect means for determining appropriate monetary policy at any given time. That said, rules of a Taylor type are a useful way to gauge where the federal funds rate should be set based on the prevailing macroeconomic conditions and outlook. Let me first say that I find these types of policy rules to be useful as indications, but I am not slavishly devoted to them.\n\nThe Taylor rule suggests policymakers ought to think about three key variables in determining the appropriate fed funds rate: inflation, the neutral rate of interest, and the output gap. As one might expect, changes in inflation and employment—one way of framing the output gap—receive due attention from Fed officials. However, changes in the neutral rate, or the policy rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is at full employment, are often underappreciated.\n\nSome argue that leaving the neutral rate, which I will refer to as r*, out of the conversation makes sense because it is unobservable and therefore highly uncertain. But so are potential growth and the natural rate of unemployment, yet they are frequently updated and discussed. Because many r* estimates are based on empirical models requiring a great deal of time-series data, they can be backward-looking and slow to adjust. Moving too slowly to update a rapidly changing neutral rate raises the risk of policy mistakes.\n\nR* reflects the balance of saving and investment in an economy and it evolves over time with demographics, productivity, fiscal policy, and other factors. It is my view that previously high immigration rates and large fiscally driven decreases in net national saving, both of which raise neutral rates, were insufficiently accounted for in previous estimates of neutral rates. Monetary policy was not as tight as many believed. That same effect may be taking place today, but in the opposite direction. In my view, insufficiently accounting for the strong downward pressure on the neutral rate resulting from changes in border and fiscal policies is leading some to believe policy islessrestrictive than it actually is.\n\nToday, I will give explicit consideration to nonmonetary factors—such as shifts in border and tax policy, trade renegotiation, and regulatory dynamics—that can have substantial effects on the appropriate setting for monetary policy. I'll focus on the factors that have changed most meaningfully over the course of 2025 as they relate to my expectations for inflation, r*, and the output gap, emphasizing ones I feel are underappreciated.\n\nBefore I proceed, I want to be clear: I am not attempting to provide an impossible degree of precision, but a general ballpark. Based on this analysis, I believe the appropriate fed funds rate is in the mid-2 percent area, almost 2 percentage points lower than current policy. The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with the important goal of promoting price stability for the good of all American households and businesses, and I am committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to 2 percent. However, leaving policy restrictive by such a large degree brings significant risks for the Fed's employment mandate.\n\nPolicies Impacting InflationRentsI'll start with inflation. The general approach I take is to assume all components of inflation that I'm not explicitly addressing will continue at their current run rates. I look forward to breaking down my expectations for other components of inflation in the future, but today I'll focus on what I consider to be first-order changes to the inflation forecast.\n\nHousing represents nearly 16 percent of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, and more than double that in the consumer price index (CPI). Housing affordability is highly influential for Americans' perception of, and experience of, the economy.\n\nBecause measured inflation incorporates rental inflation with a lag, it has remained elevated above market rents for several years, infamously \"catching up.\" While an index of all-tenant rents took time to incorporate the spike in new rents in 2021 and 2022, that gap subsequently closed, indicating the catch-up is complete.2Now, new rent indices show this inflation is well below all-tenant inflation, around 1 percent annualized.3\n\nRents for all tenants will fall toward this low rate as people moving or renewing leases sign at current market rates, and I expect CPI rent inflation will decline from its current level of roughly 3.5 percent to below 1.5 percent in 2027. This implies a roughly 0.3 percentage point decline in total PCE inflation; by early 2028, I expect that effect to grow to a 0.4 percentage point decline. Per a Taylor rule, that works out to an appropriate fed funds rate roughly half a percentage point lower than current shelter inflation would imply.4\n\nOne might characterize this view on rental inflation as optimistic. However, I believe forecasters have underappreciated the significant impact of immigration policy on rent inflation—both on the way up and, now, on the way down. Work by Albert Saiz finds an elasticity of rents with respect to the number of renters of about 1, identified from a large quasi-random immigration shock.5,iNet immigration averaged roughly 1 million per year in the decade leading up to the pandemic.6Given that roughly 100 million Americans rent, net zero immigration going forward would imply 1 point lower rent inflation per year.\n\nPolicies Affecting r*Population growthThe border story is also, in my view, affecting neutral rates. Steady-state population growth matters for neutral rates, and U.S. border policy has changed markedly, from effectively open borders to potentially negative net migration. Further, these effects may interact with a structurally aging population, which increases the supply of capital and reduces demand for investment. Indeed, analysis by Etienne Gagnon and others shows that demographic changes may have already lowered the neutral rate by over 1 percentage point since 1980.7\n\nThe U.S. population has grown by around 1 percent annually in recent years, driven in large part by illegal immigration. Already in the first half of this year, roughly 1.5 million of these immigrants have left the country, according to the Current Population Survey, though this number may be an overestimate due to nonresponse issues.8Assuming some overcounting, it is plausible to me that 2 million illegal immigrants will have exited the country by year-end, thereby reducing annual population growth from 1 percent to 0.4 percent. Based on estimates from both Weiske and Ho, a 1 percentage point drop in annual population growth can reduce r* by 0.6 percentage point. So, the expected decline in U.S. population growth equates to a nearly 0.4 percentage point drop in the neutral fed funds rate.9\n\nLabor market statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest border policy is exerting a major impact on the economy. While the effect would likely normalize over time, this reduced level of population growth is also consistent with zero net immigration in 2026 and 2027. It was just a few long years ago that there was widespread discussion about whether most developed economies would, due to declining fertility rates, converge to Japan's low interest rates without significant immigration; those economic dynamics are still a force, albeit among many others.\n\nIncreases in national saving from trade policyAdditionally, trade renegotiation and the tax legislation recently passed by the Congress should also affect r*. I think of this primarily through the increase in national saving—that is, the net supply of loanable funds.\n\nWith respect to tariffs, relatively small changes in some goods prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern. While my read of the elasticities and incidence theory is that exporting nations will have to lower their selling prices, I also believe tariffs will lead to substantial swings in net national saving.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates tariff revenue could reduce the federal budget deficit by over $380 billion per year over the coming decade.10This is a significant swing in the supply–demand balance for loanable funds, as national borrowing declines by a comparable amount. A 1 percentage point change in the deficit-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio moves r* by nearly four tenths of a percentage point, according to the average of estimates summarized by Rachel and Summers.11This 1.3 percent of GDP change in national saving reduces the neutral rate by half a percentage point.12\n\nTariffs are not the only means by which trade policy is affecting the supply of loanable funds. Loans and loan guarantees pledged by East Asian countries in exchange for relatively low tariff ceilings have reached $900 billion.13These guarantees entail an exogenous increase in credit supply, which research suggests would be around 7 percent.14Using Council of Economic Advisers' (CEA) estimates of the interest elasticity of investment and Michael Boskin's interest elasticity of saving, this would further reduce neutral policy rates by around two tenths of a percentage point.15\n\nIncreases in national saving from tax policyThe large tax law passed this year also has a strong effect on national saving.16There are, of course, other consequences of the tax law besides the increase in net national saving, which I'll discuss later in the context of the output gap.\n\nThe CEA calculates an increase in national saving of $3.83 trillion over the next 10 years (relative to the previous policy baseline), resulting from economic growth induced by tax policy.17This represents roughly 1.3 percent of GDP, implying a half of a percentage point reduction in r* and the appropriate policy rate through the Rachel–Summers channel.Indeed, the federal deficit in the second and third fiscal quarters of this year was nearly $140 billion less than in the comparable period last year. This is a small sample size but indicative, in my opinion, of the direction of the deficit.\n\nOn the other hand, the CEA estimates that the tax law will generate annual investment increases of up to 10 percent in the next several years relative to the previous policy baseline. This should be associated with an increase in r*, and thus the appropriate fed funds rate, of around three tenths of a point. Let me also note that while I am relying partially on previous CEA research at the moment, I look forward to working more with Board staff and their forecasts in the coming months.\n\nEffect of deregulation and energy on r*America's regulatory patchwork has become a material impediment to growth.18Economists tend to underappreciate the economic impact of regulations, largely because qualitative factors can be difficult to study empirically. In many cases, a regulation can serve as an infinite tax rate, prohibiting activity altogether. An interdiction on output because a special snail is found in a region will restrict output much more than any finite tax.\n\nRegulation hinders productivity growth, restricts capacity, and ultimately helps fuel inflation. Regulators may have good reason for doing so (maybe they value the snail), but we must be clear-eyed about the economic consequences.\n\nDeregulation raises the neutral rate of interest by increasing the marginal product of capital.19Analysis by Dawson and Seater shows that half of the output effects of deregulatory policy are channeled improvements in total factor productivity (TFP), the key ingredient to greater living standards and higher real wages for workers.20Previous CEA research on the benefits of deregulatory efforts suggests a roughly 0.5 percent annual boost to growth over a 20-year period, whereas CEA research on new energy policies suggests something closer to a 0.1 percent annual boost over a 10-year period.21The cumulative effect of these policies is anywhere from a 3 to nearly 9 percent increase in TFP, translating to about a 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point increase in r*.22\n\nPolicies Impacting the Output GapTax policyI'd like to shift from r* to the third component of the Taylor rule, the output gap, which reflects actual production's strength relative to the economy's potential. Analogously, policymakers frequently think of the employment gap as the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the lowest sustainable rate of unemployment that doesn't gin up inflation. While the substantial tax and spending cuts recently passed by the Congress increase net saving and therefore reduce r*, there are countervailing increases in appropriate policy via the output gap.\n\nThe tax law should significantly push out the economy's supply side, an important change to help minimize the potential for inflationary shocks. Reduced business and individual tax rates stimulate additional capital accumulation and labor supply. However, these work through expanding potentialandactual GDP and thus should leave the output gap relatively unchanged. Aggregate demand, however, is also boosted by reduced taxes on seniors and lower-wage workers, balanced somewhat by cuts to entitlement spending and student lending.\n\nRelative to a pretax law policy baseline, CEA calculations using Congressional Budget Office estimates found a static $80 billion or so reduction in revenue and a $130 billion or so reduction in annual spending over a decade. Despite a greater reduction in spending than taxes, the literature consistently finds the tax multiplier to be larger than the spending multiplier.23This implies an increase of actual output over potential of approximately $50 billion in the short run, or an increase in the output gap of nearly 0.2 percent of GDP. This translates into an increase in the appropriate federal funds rate of around 0.1 percentage point under the standard approach to the Taylor rule. The balanced-approach rule, which doubles the weight on the output gap and was favored by former Chairwoman Janet Yellen, would imply a 0.2 percentage point increase.24\n\nRegulatory and energy policiesReturning to deregulatory and energy policies: Typically, when a regulatory barrier is removed, there is an immediate increase in potential output, but it takes time for actual output to catch up. I expect recent policies to have this effect.\n\nUsing the same estimates for TFP as I used earlier, this suggests 0.2 to 0.6 percentage point of downward pressure on the output gap over the next couple of years.25That translates into a policy rate that is 0.1 to 0.3 point lower under a standard Taylor rule, or doubly as strong under the balanced-approach rule.\n\nAdding It All UpTo sum this all up, first we must adjust r* relative to a baseline based on the factors I've described. A variety of models reviewed by Gianluca Benigno and others arrive at a median real estimate for r* of 1.3 percent, and a range of around 1 to 2 percent.26Applying Okun's law with a natural unemployment rate of 4 percent, and PCE inflation at 2.6 percent, the standard Taylor rule approach implies the appropriate nominal fed funds rate prior to the forces considered today should be about 3.9 percent. A balanced approach suggests 3.6 percent. These are not all that far from where the FOMC has set interest rates!\n\nIncluding the shocks I've considered, I get a new real r* that is 1 to 1.2 percentage points lower, or near zero. That sounds low, but I think it's important to take these modelsseriously, notliterally,and as I've said, I think these models sometimes don't do a great job incorporating policy changes of the type I've discussed at the frequency I need. Instead, I suspect existing backward-looking estimates are too high because they insufficiently account for recent changes to fiscal and border policies that are depressing r*.\n\nWe can also look to financial markets. My preferred market-implied measure of r* is the five-year, five-year-forward rate on U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. That's around 2.3 percent, meaning the new real r* would be 1.1 percent when applying new policy pressures.\n\nIncluding the inflation and output channels along with the median model-implied r*, the fed funds rate should be around 2 to 2.25 percent under the standard Taylor rule approach. The balanced approach implies a rate around 1.5 to 2 percent. If we instead use the market-implied r*, these numbers would all be one full point higher.27\n\nTo help correct for the risk that the model-implied rate is too low, I weight its likelihood at two-thirds and give the market-implied r* a one-third weighting. I've given market pricing just one-third partially because I believe it is incorporating a policy premium to reflect uncertainty around trade policy. Using these weights results in an appropriate fed funds rate of approximately 2 percent under the balanced approach and 2.5 percent under the standard rule, although a simple summation ignores issues of timing.28\n\nTo be clear, I don't want to imply more precision than I think is possible in economics. Assumptions and approximations abound. Nevertheless, I must stake out a position, and this is my best ballpark estimation.\n\nThe upshot is that monetary policy is well into restrictive territory. Leaving short-term interest rates roughly 2 percentage points too tight risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment. Thank you for this opportunity to share how I think about monetary policy at the moment; I'd be happy to take some questions.\n\nNote: Table weights for ex-ante r* are 2/3 from the model-implied results from Benigno and others (2024) and 1/3 from the market-implied rate from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. FFR is federal funds rate. OBBB is One Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n1.

This $900 billion is only a subset of the more than $3 trillion of U.S. investment pledges made by foreign countries in recent months. While this pledged investment would certainly be expected to lead to new activity, the bulk of it would likely leave the supply–demand balance for loanable funds, and therefore r*, relatively unchanged. This is because, apart from the $900 billion in loan guarantees, much of these commitments are in the form of direct investment, which is less likely to exert pressure on r* despite a strong positive impact on output. Gokceli, Fidrmuc, and Ghosh (2022) find no evidence that FDI crowds out domestic investment in developed OECD countries; see Emre Gokceli, Jan Fidrmuc, and Sugata Ghosh (2022), \"Effect of Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth and Domestic Investment: Evidence from OECD Countries,\"European Journal of Business Science and Technology, vol. 8 (2), pp. 190–216.Return to text\n\n14. Work done by Bachas, Kim, and Yannelis (2021) indicates that loan guarantees contribute to increased credit supply, and the elasticity estimated in their work suggests that loan guarantees of this magnitude imply an exogenous 7 percent increase in credit supply. To translate this into an effect on r*, estimates of the interest elasticity of investment demand and the interest elasticity of saving supply can be used. The former can be backed out from the UCC elasticity of investment and the interest elasticity of UCC (which multiply to the interest elasticity of investment). Using this approach with parameters from Council of Economic Advisers (2025c) yields an interest elasticity of investment of approximately negative 0.3. Meanwhile, estimates from Boskin (1978) are used for the interest elasticity of saving. Boskin uses multiple estimation strategies and finds estimates centered around 0.3.

Based on all the data in hand, I believe this argument is even stronger today, and that the downside risks to the labor market have increased.\n\nIn July, I warned that job creation was weaker than it seemed in the payroll numbers and that data due in early September would indicate that payroll growth will be significantly lowered when annual revisions are made next spring. But even before then, job creation came in soft in the employment report for July, and May and June were revised down sharply, for a three-month average pace for total nonfarm payroll growth of only 35,000. After accounting for these revisions and what we will learn in a couple of weeks, the data are likely to indicate that employment actually shrank over those three months. I will have more to say about labor market data revisions and how they should be treated in evaluating the monthly jobs report, one of the most valuable tools we have for judging economic conditions.\n\nI favored reducing the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the FOMC's July meeting, and subsequent data on the labor market and inflation indicate this was the right call. That also seems to be the message from financial markets, which now expect a 25- basis-point cut at the FOMC's September meeting and put significant odds on an additional one or two cuts at the final two meetings of 2025. As I will discuss, factoring out estimates of the temporary effects of import tariffs, underlying inflation remains close to 2 percent. I believe the data on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation support moving policy toward a neutral setting. Based on the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run value of the federal funds rate, neutral is 125 to 150 basis points lower than the current setting. While I believe we should have cut in July, I am still hopeful that easing monetary policy at our next meeting can keep the labor market from deteriorating while returning inflation to the FOMC's goal of 2 percent. So, let's get on with it.\n\nEconomic activity has slowed significantly in 2025 from 2024. Growth for the first half of the year was 1.4 percent.iLooking ahead, the limited evidence we have is consistent with continued sluggish growth. We don't have much data for the second half, but smoothing through the monthly volatility, retail sales for July suggest that consumers are continuing to spend, albeit at a slower pace than last year. Meanwhile, manufacturing output in the report on industrial production was flat in July, and according to purchasing managers, new orders for manufacturing are consistent with a modest decline in the next few months. For the large majority of businesses outside of manufacturing, new orders are consistent with roughly flat production in the coming months.\n\nMany forecasters have said they expect household and business spending and investment decisions will be weighed down by tariffs—those enacted, and the uncertainty about tariff levels in the future. Tariffs affect the costs and profits of businesses and, to the degree that they raise prices, also affect the real disposable income of consumers. Some businesses will be directly affected by tariffs, but many more will be affected by how tariffs crimp household spending. Tariff effects on households and businesses also will weigh on employment. All of this is consistent with what my business contacts are telling me, which is that they are postponing investment and hiring because of the uncertainty about how tariffs will affect their input costs and demand for their products. That said, I'm starting to hear some rumblings that businesses cannot sit on the sidelines forever. So we could see, at least, investment projects that were postponed begin to pick up, which would be positive for the economy. But how employment decisions evolve is more up in the air. I will be monitoring these business decisions because they are key to how activity will unfold in the second half of the year.\n\nReturning to the labor market, risks are continuing to build. In my July 17 speech, I said that private-sector job creation was nearing stall speed, and the data received since then have put an exclamation point on this statement. I always say that one month is not a trend, but now we have three months of weak job-creation data from the Current Employment Statistics. After revisions included in the July report, private-sector job creation averaged 52,000 in May, June, and July, about half the rate in the first quarter of 2025. The headline numbers, including public-sector workers, are, as I noted earlier, even worse, but I tend to focus on the private sector as a better indication of the underlying momentum in the labor market.\n\nThat's the picture after the unusually large revisions to May and June payrolls and the soft reading for July that was included in the latest jobs report. In addition to those revisions, on September 9 we will get a preliminary estimate of what to expect in the annual \"benchmark\" revisions to 2025 early next year. I estimate that monthly job creation will be reduced by an average of about 60,000 a month.3That would mean that private-sector employment actually shrank, on average, in the past three months and that job creation earlier in the year was weaker than currently reported.4\n\nI have heard the argument that declining labor supply due to lower immigration means that low jobs numbers aren't as bad as they look and that the \"breakeven\" number for keeping the unemployment rate steady is declining. To those people, I would say: Yes, these estimates have been falling, but I haven't heard anyone say the breakeven level is negative. Supply-side changes can't account for the ugly jobs numbers of the past three months.\n\nOther data support the idea that labor demand may be on the edge of a sharp decline. For example, wage growth for people switching to new jobs is lower than for people staying in the same job, the opposite of what we see in a strong labor market. A few years ago, the rate of people quitting their jobs surged, and job switchers were getting substantially larger raises than those staying in their jobs. Today the quits rate is back down to its mid-2010s level, and these individuals must be switching jobs for reasons other than gains in compensation.\n\nAnother sign of a weakening in the labor market is that the unemployment rates for some cyclically sensitive groups of workers, such as teenagers, are up sharply this year, to levels, again, similar to those in the softer job market of the mid-2010s. Supplementing this hard evidence of falling labor demand is the consistent story from my business contacts that they are not hiring. The mix of reasons is not only uncertainty over tariff policy and slowing demand for their goods and services, but also, increasingly, uncertainty over how to use artificial intelligence, which is especially freezing hiring for some entry-level jobs.5\n\nThis softening in labor demand is occurring at the same time, as I noted earlier, that there is a decline in labor supply. I often hear the argument that the unemployment rate is the key labor market indicator because it reflects what is happening in both demand and supply. And given that the current unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, close to most estimates of maximum employment and barely changed over the last year, this suggests that the labor market is solid. While I would normally agree with this statement, I do not think it is accurate now. I believe that any decline in labor supply is only masking weakening demand in the labor market. Whether or not supply is down, weakening demand is not good, and it is specifically what monetary policy is intended to address.\n\nBefore I move on from the labor market, let me address a question of some public debate recently, which is the quality of the payroll data. As should be obvious from these remarks and others I have delivered, I consider the monthly jobs report, including its estimate of payroll employment, an absolutely indispensable tool in evaluating the economy and setting monetary policy, and that view is close to unanimous among economic forecasters and policymakers. Considering how important this data is in getting an accurate and reliable read on the state of the labor market, it is entirely appropriate to examine the quality of the jobs numbers and the process by which they are collected. There is always room for improvement in data collection and analysis. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other agencies that collect economic data have benefited from expert committees of outside advisers who have provided advice on ways to improve data quality.\n\nThere has been substantial commentary since the last jobs report regarding the declining response rate of establishments and individuals in the employment survey and the outsized revisions of the data. This commentary has raised questions about the quality of the employment survey data. So I want to address this issue and clarify some facts about the survey response and the revisions. When the BLS sends out the establishment survey for a given month, it gives firms three months to return the survey—they can return it in the first month, the second month, or the third month. Some firms do not respond at all. Firms that submit their responses in the first month are the basis for the initial, or preliminary, payroll estimate. Those firms that respond in the second month get added to the first-month responders to get an updated number, which yields the first revision that is published a month later. Then the firms that respond in the final month provide the BLS with the final numbers for the original month. This is the second revision and is the official payroll estimate for that month.\n\nA decade ago, the response rate for the first month was 75 percent, meaning three-fourths of the firms surveyed responded immediately. But the initial response rate has fallen to 60 percent recently. Does that imply that the overall response rate for the entire three-month period has fallen? No, response rates by the final estimate have not fallen—about 95 percent of firms responded a decade ago, and that is how many are responding now. What has happened is that U.S. firms are slower in returning the survey. Ten years ago, if the survey had been sent to 100 firms, 75 would respond in the first month, and 20 firms would respond in the next two months. But now only 60 firms respond in the first month, and 35 firms respond in the second and third months. But in both cases, 95 out of 100 firms surveyed responded.6\n\nWhat are the implications of this delayed response pattern? First, if more data come in later in the survey period, then the initial estimate is less likely to accurately represent the final estimate, which means you are more likely to get significant revisions in the second and third months. The revisions do not mean the quality of the data has declined; it simply reflects the fact that more data is coming in late in the survey period.\n\nA second point is that revisions have been, on average, negative for the past couple of years, and while the recent revisions were large, revisions have not been getting bigger, on average, based on an analysis recently issued by economists at J.P. Morgan.7They did find that large revisions are often associated with major turning points in the labor market. One possibility is that the recent large revisions in the payroll data for May and June indicate the labor market is at an inflection point and may worsen in coming months.\n\nOverall, the delay in responses does mean that we can expect initial reports to be noisier and more prone to revision. One month of data has never constituted a trend, but it is going to be especially important to take near-month payroll data with a grain of salt and form a picture of the labor market based on several months of results and a range of other labor market indicators. I hope my analysis of the labor market shows you that I do exactly that.\n\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. Earlier this month, we received consumer and producer price information for July that allows for an estimate of inflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the FOMC's preferred measure. Based on those reports, PCE inflation increased 2.6 percent over the 12 months ended in July, and PCE inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices increased 2.9 percent. We will get the official data tomorrow.\n\nInflation has increased since the first quarter, but these numbers include the effects of import tariff increases, which, with inflation expectations anchored, I continue to expect will only temporarily raise inflation. Federal Reserve staff has extracted the tariff effects of inflation, and their latest estimates imply that without these effects, underlying inflation continues to run close to the FOMC's 2 percent target.8\n\nThere is still considerable uncertainty about how much more, and how quickly, tariffs will pass through to consumer prices. I have seen estimates that vary widely in the share of tariffs borne by exporters, importers, and consumers, and that tells me that one must be careful not to presume that some will bear a lot more than others. I continue to assume that the three groups affected by tariffs will share the costs roughly equally—one-third, one-third, and one-third. Most forecasts are for 12-month inflation to continue to slowly increase for a couple more months, with monthly tariff effects dissipating by early 2026.\n\nI believe that monetary policy should look through the tariff effects on inflation. With underlying inflation close to 2 percent, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now. I felt this way in July, and all the evidence since then has led me to feel more strongly about it today. Based on what I know today, I would support a 25 basis point cut at the Committee's meeting on September 16 and 17. While there are signs of a weakening labor market, I worry that conditions could deteriorate further and quite rapidly, and I think it is important that the FOMC not wait until such a deterioration is under way and risk falling behind the curve in setting appropriate monetary policy.\n\nMy eagerness to move now is supported by my view that monetary policy is moderately restrictive. In June, the median of FOMC participants estimated that the longer-run value of the federal funds rate, akin to what it would be now without restricting or stimulating the economy, is 3 percent. With the target for the federal funds rate in a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, that means we are 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percentage points above neutral.\n\nWhile I judge that the FOMC should have begun this process in July, based on the data in hand, I don't believe that a cut of larger than 25 basis points is needed in September. That view, of course, could change if the employment report for August, due out a week from tomorrow, points to a substantially weakening economy and inflation remains well contained.\n\nI think there is a growing consensus that monetary policy needs to be more accommodative, and even some recognition that it would have been wise to begin this process in July. I don't believe that policy has fallen substantially behind the curve, but one way to signal that I don't intend to allow that happen is to talk about where we go after September. Like other participants, I will be updating my economic projections just before the next FOMC meeting, including my assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of this year and next. The totality of the data and the outlook will determine how quickly I believe we need to move policy to a neutral setting, but as I stand here today, I anticipate additional cuts over the next three to six months, and the pace of rate cuts will be driven by the incoming data.\n\n1.

My estimate of the anticipated revision is based on the difference between the currently published level of payroll employment and the count of employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which is used to benchmark the payroll employment figures. The QCEW data, which are currently available through 2024:Q4, suggest that the monthly change in payroll employment has been overstated by roughly 60,000 per month since March 2024.Return to text\n\n4. I also look at timely data that Federal Reserve staff maintains in collaboration with the employment services firm ADP to construct a measure of weekly payroll employment, which covers about 20 percent of the nation's private workforce. This measure is comparable to the one ADP publishes. The current May–July contour for the staff measure of ADP-based private employment is broadly consistent with that of the Current Employment Statistics numbers. And in the weeks after the July jobs report's reference period, preliminary estimates from ADP show continued deterioration.Return to text\n\n5.

{"title": "Powell, Monetary Policy and the Fed’s Framework Review", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250822a.htm", "author": "Powell", "subject": "Monetary Policy and the Fed’s Framework Review", "description": "Speech At “Labor Markets in Transition:  Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy,” an economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming", "category": "Speech", "pub_date": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT", "content": "slide 1\n\nOver the course of this year, the U.S. economy has shown resilience in a context of sweeping changes in economic policy. In terms of the Fed's dual-mandate goals, the labor market remains near maximum employment, and inflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. At the same time, the balance of risks appears to be shifting.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will first address the current economic situation and the near-term outlook for monetary policy. I will then turn to the results of our second public review of our monetary policy framework, as captured in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we released today.\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Near-Term OutlookWhen I appeared at this podium one year ago, the economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply. Inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state. Upside risks to inflation had diminished. But the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions.1Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year(figure 1).\n\nThis year, the economy has faced new challenges. Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth. Over the longer run, changes in tax, spending, and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these polices will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.\n\nChanges in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply. In this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural, developments is difficult. This distinction is critical because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.\n\nThe labor market is a case in point. The July employment report released earlier this month showed that payroll job growth slowed to an average pace of only 35,000 per month over the past three months, down from 168,000 per month during 2024(figure 2).2This slowdown is much larger than assessed just a month ago, as the earlier figures for May and June were revised down substantially.3But it does not appear that the slowdown in job growth has opened up a large margin of slack in the labor market—an outcome we want to avoid. The unemployment rate, while edging up in July, stands at a historically low level of 4.2 percent and has been broadly stable over the past year. Other indicators of labor market conditions are also little changed or have softened only modestly, including quits, layoffs, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, and nominal wage growth. Labor supply has softened in line with demand, sharply lowering the \"breakeven\" rate of job creation needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. Indeed, labor force growth has slowed considerably this year with the sharp falloff in immigration, and the labor force participation rate has edged down in recent months.\n\nOverall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\n\nAt the same time, GDP growth has slowed notably in the first half of this year to a pace of 1.2 percent, roughly half the 2.5 percent pace in 2024(figure 3). The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending. As with the labor market, some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.\n\nTurning to inflation, higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods. Estimates based on the latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent, above their level a year ago. Within core, prices of goods increased 1.1 percent over the past 12 months, a notable shift from the modest decline seen over the course of 2024. In contrast, housing services inflation remains on a downward trend, and nonhousing services inflation is still running at a level a bit above what has been historically consistent with 2 percent inflation(figure 4).4\n\nThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. A reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived—a one-time shift in the price level. Of course, \"one-time\" does not mean \"all at once.\" It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\n\nIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. One possibility is that workers, who see their real incomes decline because of higher prices, demand and get higher wages from employers, setting off adverse wage–price dynamics. Given that the labor market is not particularly tight and faces increasing downside risks, that outcome does not seem likely.\n\nAnother possibility is that inflation expectations could move up, dragging actual inflation with them. Inflation has been above our target for more than four years and remains a prominent concern for households and businesses. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, however, as reflected in market- and survey-based measures, appear to remain well anchored and consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\n\nOf course, we cannot take the stability of inflation expectations for granted. Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.\n\nPutting the pieces together, what are the implications for monetary policy? In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside—a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\n\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\n\nEvolution of Monetary Policy FrameworkTurning to my second topic, our monetary policy framework is built on the unchanging foundation of our mandate from Congress to foster maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We remain fully committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate, and the revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as our consensus statement, describes how we pursue our dual-mandate goals. It is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective.\n\nThe changes we made in this review are a natural progression, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. We continue to build upon the initial consensus statement adopted in 2012 under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. Today's revised statement is the outcome of the second public review of our framework, which we conduct at five-year intervals.  This year's review included three elements: Fed Listens events at Reserve Banks around the country, a flagship research conference, and policymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings.5\n\nIn approaching this year's review, a key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions. At the same time, the framework needs to evolve with changes in the structure of the economy and our understanding of those changes. The Great Depression presented different challenges from those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn are different from the ones we face today.6\n\nAt the time of the last review, we were living in a new normal, characterized by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound (ELB), along with low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve—meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy.7To me, a statistic that captures that era is that our policy rate was stuck at the ELB for seven long years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in late 2008. Many here will recall the sluggish growth and painfully slow recovery of that era. It appeared highly likely that if the economy experienced even a mild downturn, our policy rate would be back at the ELB very quickly, probably for another extended period. Inflation and inflation expectations could then decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates were pinned near zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations, triggering an adverse dynamic.\n\nThe economic conditions that brought the policy rate to the ELB and drove the 2020 framework changes were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that would persist for an extended period—and might well have done so, if not for the pandemic.8The 2020 consensus statement included several features that addressed the ELB-related risks that had become increasingly prominent over the preceding two decades. We emphasized the importance of anchored longer-term inflation expectations to support both our price-stability and maximum-employment goals. Drawing on an extensive literature on strategies to mitigate risks associated with the ELB, we adopted flexible average inflation targeting—a \"makeup\" strategy to ensure that inflation expectations would remain well anchored even with the ELB constraint.9In particular, we said that, following periods when inflation had been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\n\nIn the event, rather than low inflation and the ELB, the post-pandemic reopening brought the highest inflation in 40 years to economies around the world. Like most other central banks and private-sector analysts, through year-end 2021 we thought that inflation would subside fairly quickly without a sharp tightening in our policy stance(figure 5).10When it became clear that this was not the case, we responded forcefully, raising our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points over 16 months. That action, combined with the unwinding of pandemic supply disruptions, contributed to inflation moving much closer to our target without the painful rise in unemployment that has accompanied previous efforts to counter high inflation.\n\nElements of the Revised Consensus StatementThis year's review considered how economic conditions have evolved over the past five years. During this period, we saw that the inflation situation can change rapidly in the face of large shocks. In addition, interest rates are now substantially higher than was the case during the era between the GFC and the pandemic. With inflation above target, our policy rate is restrictive—modestly so, in my view. We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the 2010s, reflecting changes in productivity, demographics, fiscal policy, and other factors that affect the balance between saving and investment(figure 6). During the review, we discussed how the 2020 statement's focus on the ELB may have complicated communications about our response to high inflation. We concluded that the emphasis on an overly specific set of economic conditions may have led to some confusion, and, as a result, we made several important changes to the consensus statement to reflect that insight.\n\nFirst, we removed language indicating that the ELB was a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, we noted that our \"monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions.\" The difficulty of operating near the ELB remains a potential concern, but it is not our primary focus. The revised statement reiterates that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum-employment and price-stability goals, particularly if the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.\n\nSecond, we returned to a framework of flexible inflation targeting and eliminated the \"makeup\" strategy. As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021.11\n\nWell-anchored inflation expectations were critical to our success in bringing down inflation without a sharp increase in unemployment. Anchored expectations promote the return of inflation to target when adverse shocks drive inflation higher, and limit the risk of deflation when the economy weakens.12Further, they allow monetary policy to support maximum employment in economic downturns without compromising price stability. Our revised statement emphasizes our commitment to act forcefully to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, to the benefit of both sides of our dual mandate. It also notes that \"price stability is essential for a sound and stable economy and supports the well-being of all Americans.\" This theme came through loud and clear at ourFed Listensevents.13The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.\n\nThird, our 2020 statement said that we would mitigate \"shortfalls,\" rather than \"deviations,\" from maximum employment. The use of \"shortfalls\" reflected the insight that our real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment—and hence of \"maximum employment\"—are highly uncertain.14The later years of the post-GFC recovery featured employment running for an extended period above mainstream estimates of its sustainable level, along with inflation running persistently below our 2 percent target. In the absence of inflationary pressures, it might not be necessary to tighten policy based solely on uncertain real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.15\n\nWe still have that view, but our use of the term \"shortfalls\" was not always interpreted as intended, raising communications challenges. In particular, the use of \"shortfalls\" was not intended as a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to ignore labor market tightness. Accordingly, we removed \"shortfalls\" from our statement. Instead, the revised document now states more precisely that \"the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability.\" Of course, preemptive action would likely be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability.\n\nThe revised statement also notes that maximum employment is \"the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.\" This focus on promoting a strong labor market underscores the principle that \"durably achieving maximum employment fosters broad-based economic opportunities and benefits for all Americans.\"The feedback we received atFed Listensevents reinforced the value of a strong labor market for American households, employers, and communities.\n\nFourth, consistent with the removal of \"shortfalls,\" we made changes to clarify our approach in periods when our employment and inflation objectives are not complementary. In those circumstances, we will follow a balanced approach in promoting them. The revised statement now more closely aligns with the original 2012 language. We take into account the extent of departures from our goals and the potentially different time horizons over which each is projected to return to a level consistent with our dual mandate. These principles guide our policy decisions today, as they did over the 2022–24 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\n\nIn addition to these changes, there is a great deal of continuity with past statements. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. For this reason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to that outlook. We continue to believe that setting a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.\n\nWe also continue to view a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent as most consistent with our dual-mandate goals. We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Experience has shown that 2 percent inflation is low enough to ensure that inflation is not a concern in household and business decisionmaking while also providing a central bank with some policy flexibility to provide accommodation during economic downturns.\n\nFinally, the revised consensus statement retained our commitment to conduct a public review roughly every five years. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace. That frequency allows policymakers to reassess structural features of the economy and to engage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our framework. It is also consistent with several global peers.\n\nConclusionIn closing, I want to thank President Schmid and all his staff who work so diligently to host this outstanding event annually. Counting a couple of virtual appearances during the pandemic, this is the eighth time I have had the honor to speak from this podium. Each year, this symposium offers the opportunity for Federal Reserve leaders to hear ideas from leading economic thinkers and focus on the challenges we face. The Kansas City Fed was wise to lure Chair Volcker to this national park more than 40 years ago, and I am proud to be part of that tradition.\n\n1.

Using the consumer price index and other information, an estimate of the contribution of housing services to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was 0.7 percentage point, while core services excluding housing contributed 2.0 percentage points. The contribution from each of these categories remains slightly above its average during the 2002–07 period, during which core PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent. In contrast, the contribution of core goods to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was about 0.25 percentage point, compared with the 2002–07 average of −0.25 percentage point.Return to text\n\n5.

While I have always been interested in the topic, I would have never imagined decades ago that payments would generate this amount of enthusiasm, where now some of the coolest jobs in tech are working in this area.\n\nThe payment system is experiencing what I have called a \"technology-driven revolution,\" where the latest advances in computing power, data processing, and distributed networks have fueled growth in innovative new payment services.2This includes 24/7 instant payments, user-friendly digital wallets and mobile payment apps, and stablecoins and other digital assets. Alongside these new services sits enabling technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that has the potential to improve the precision and efficiency of the underlying payment products even further.\n\nWhile there has been a lot of excitement, and admittedly sometimes hype, around the possibilities of these new technologies, there have also been some who have been fearful or skeptical of innovation in this space. But we only have to look to history to see that the evolution of the payment system has long been a story of technological advancement.\n\nIn any payment transaction, three things happen. First, an object is bought and paid for with another object. Second, there is a technology for conducting this transaction. Finally, there is a technology for recording the history of the transaction and ownership of the objects. For example, I can go to the grocery store and buy an apple and use a digital dollar in my checking account to pay for it. I tap my debit card on a card reader to conduct the transaction. Finally, the machine prints out a receipt, which is the record of the transaction. The same process applies to the crypto world. I buy a meme coin and use a stablecoin as the means of payment. The transaction takes place using a smart contract. Finally, the transaction is recorded on a distributed ledger.3There is nothing scary about this just because it occurs in the decentralized finance or defi world—this is simply new technology to transfer objects and record transactions. There is nothing to be afraid of when thinking about using smart contracts, tokenization, or distributed ledgers in everyday transactions.\n\nThe technologies available today might be new, but leveraging innovative technology to build new payment services is not a new story. What I'd like to emphasize today is that the private and public sectors can both embrace innovation within their respective roles.\n\nFirst, I will recap how I generally approach these issues. I am a strong believer in the benefits of the free market. I hold the view that it is generally the private sector that can most reliably and efficiently allocate resources and take risks to explore the value of new technologies. I also see firsthand the important role the Federal Reserve plays in fostering a payment and settlement system that is both safe and efficient. Such a system promotes a vibrant economy, since it allows for participation from a broad range of individuals and businesses without requiring them to invest heavily in bilateral arrangements.4\n\nI would argue that broadly, there have been two models of payments innovation, which can be useful in characterizing the longer-term arc of payments evolution, as well as some recent developments. The first is private sector-driven innovation. As I have noted, this should be the default model. The second approach is where public sector entities like the Fed build platforms that enable the private sector to offer services to their customers. This should be done only rarely, and in instances where there is a specific market need. Both models are important in the payments ecosystem, and I'll walk through some historical and recent examples.\n\nLet's take the first model of private sector-led innovation and use payment cards as an example. Early cards were metal plates or cardboard, then they incorporated magnetic strips, then chips, and now I tap my phone to pay. In the early days of consumer credit used for transactional purposes, privately operated card companies seized on the availability of new technology to support automated card authorizations and processing, continually upgrading over time, to build what are now global networks of interconnected banks that support the preferred payment method for consumers and many small businesses in the United States.5Here, the private sector demonstrated its ability to effectively build a payment service that met the needs of consumers, all based on proprietary technology. Even still, card networks interact with the broader payments, clearing, and settlement ecosystem, benefitting from Fed-operated payment infrastructures for settlement of interbank obligations.6\n\nStablecoins are the latest example of private sector-led innovation in payments.7The original use of stablecoins was to facilitate crypto trading. Crypto-asset prices can be volatile and as with any financial market, there is a need for traders to move out of relatively risky positions into safer ones with a stable asset price. As the stablecoin market matured, firms found that the properties of stablecoins using distributed ledger technology— including 24/7 availability, fast transferability, and their freely circulating nature —could be attractive for other use cases as well. That includes providing a means to access and hold U.S. dollars, particularly in countries with high inflation or without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services. In fact, I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally. Stablecoins also have the potential to improve retail and cross-border payments.\n\nI spoke about the maturing stablecoin market in February of this year, and, at the time, I noted the need for a regulatory regime for stablecoins in the U.S to provide regulatory clarity and reduce regulatory fragmentation for market participants.8Last month, the GENIUS Act became the first major crypto-asset legislation to become law. This was an important step for the payment stablecoin market and could help stablecoins reach their full potential. Stablecoins, like card payments, are a private sector-driven innovation. And, like card payments, we see connections to the traditional payments, clearing, and settlement ecosystem. For example, many stablecoin arrangements use legacy payment services to fund and redeem stablecoin balances.\n\nIn addition to stablecoins, the use of AI in payments is an area where we are seeing significant private sector-led innovation. Here, AI is not serving as payments infrastructure but as an enabling technology that could bring considerable benefits to both private and public sector-operated payment services.\n\nIt may surprise some to learn that, within the financial sector, the payments industry has long been at the forefront of AI adoption. This is true for several major waves of AI technology. Since the early 1990s, payment firms have used machine learning for things like detecting fraud and money laundering, or predicting payment flows and trends.9\n\nMore recently, as large language models and generative AI have matured, payments innovators have used the technology to further enhance fraud detection and compliance systems and to make the cumbersome process of reconciling payments files more accurate and efficient. Agentic AI systems, which operate autonomously by planning and executing multistep processes, appear to be the next wave of AI advancement. While agentic AI is still in its early days, payments innovators in the private sector are once again channeling the promise of this technology and rapidly building out various use cases.\n\nNow, let's touch briefly on the second model of public sector innovation of payments infrastructures to support the private sector. Almost since its founding, the Federal Reserve has provided core clearing and settlement infrastructure to maintain the safety and efficiency of the payment system. The Fed has consistently upgraded the infrastructure over time using the latest available technology. For example, in the early 20th century, interbank transfers were effected through telegraph wires—an early version of Fedwire—then through emerging forms of electronic payment messages. Now fast-forward to this century where we have interbank payment systems that process transactions in real time.10Banks, payment services providers, and even fintechs have used the infrastructure provided by the Fed to build payment services that their customers demand.\n\nAll of this is to demonstrate that the evolution of the payment system has long been a story of technological advancement. Much of this evolution has been led by private sector innovators. Key components have been supported by the Federal Reserve, either providing core infrastructure as a payment system operator or in convening the industry around specific solutions like payment standards.11These complementary roles have led to a U.S. payment system that operates safely and efficiently and serves as a backbone for commerce in the U.S. and globally. That is why it is important for the Federal Reserve to continue to embrace technological advancements to modernize its services and continue to support private sector innovation.\n\nThe Fed is also conducting technical research on the latest wave of innovations, including tokenization, smart contracts, and AI in payments. As a payment system operator, it is important to understand trends in payments technology so that we can continue to support private sector firms that leverage our infrastructures, as well as understand whether emerging technologies could provide opportunities to improve our existing platforms and services. Finally, we engage with innovators like you to better understand new technologies and their potential to improve payments. In fact, it is my belief that the Federal Reserve could benefit from further engagement with innovators in industry, particularly as there is increased convergence between the traditional financial sector and the digital asset ecosystem. We are working on ways to further that engagement, so stay tuned.\n\n1. Thank you to Alex Sproveri and Kirstin Wells of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing this text.

We are at the beginning of what appears to be a seismic shift in the way we think about money, value, and the fabric of our financial system. This shift is not just about incremental changes or tweaks to the existing system. What we are witnessing has the potential to fundamentally transform the way we live, work, and interact in society.\n\nIt is inspiring to be together with all of you, as thought leaders engaged in developing technologies that could help shape the financial system in the future. You don't need a tech background to appreciate the opportunity that blockchain provides to the financial system.\n\nFinancial services innovation drives faster, safer, cheaper, and more customized products that more efficiently meet the needs of consumers and businesses. Digital processes like wire transfers and ACH disrupted the need to move large amounts of physical currency and other hard assets, making the system more efficient and safer. Through technology, there is opportunity to transform how we think about transferring assets.\n\nThroughout recent history, whether previous transformations involved industrialization, communications, or the internet, each of these advances had a profound and lasting impact on our society. While the future is unknown and unknowable, I expect we will look back at some point to consider the impact of blockchain, AI, and quantum computing and marvel at the transformation of everyday business processes. Time will tell, but the opportunities and possibilities that lie ahead may be profound.\n\nOf course, you know better than most that bank regulators approach technology and periods of change with caution and skepticism, concerned about rapid growth, new business models, greater interconnectedness and interdependence, often focusing only on the risks. But risks may be offset or at least determined to be manageable when we recognize and consider the potentially extensive benefits of new technology.\n\nToday, I'd like to address the Federal Reserve's approach to thinking about technology and tools like blockchain in context of bank supervision, including recent developments, the cost of supervisory focus on \"reputational risk,\" and principles for a tailored regulatory framework that accommodates technology.\n\nReframing the Regulatory MindsetBank regulators work to promote safety and soundness in the financial system through regulation and supervisory practices. Our goal is not just a safe and sound banking system, but one that also serves its intended purpose of supporting consumers, businesses, and communities, and fostering economic growth. To accomplish this goal, regulators strive to strike a balance between managing risks that threaten safety and soundness, while also creating an environment that allows new technologies to take root and grow.\n\nInnovation outside the banking system often complements the development and use of technology within the banking system, and often far outpaces that growth. As you're all aware, many groundbreaking tech innovations have been pioneered by developers outside of the traditional banking system.\n\nDevelopments in the Banking SystemWe are seeing a number of promising developments in the banking and financial system, and I'll start with tokenization.\n\nWhile progress on tokenization is moving ahead, it's helpful to identify and understand the problem that it is intended to solve. One clear friction is in the transfer of asset ownership, which includes both completing the asset transfer—which may involve re-registering securities, or transferring physical assets—and coordinating the timing of the purchase and sale. Asset transfer frameworks are designed to minimize the risk of transaction failures, and have historically relied on escrow agents and manual processes. Tokenization has the potential to facilitate faster ownership transfer, mitigating some of these well-known risks and potentially lowering costs in the process.\n\nTokenized assets enable a transferor to pass title without changing a custodian or moving any physical security or asset. Many banks and international organizations have begun projects to develop this technology, but we have not yet seen broad adoption. It is possible that we could see a \"tipping point\" where the processes themselves are well-established, and legal frameworks have been updated to permit a wider range of activities relying on the new technology, and tokenized asset transfers become more of a market standard.\n\nThere are other potential advantages to tokenization, including expanding access to capital markets and facilitating near real-time payments. The speed and cost of wholesale payments, especially internationally, is a longstanding problem that tokenization could help to address. Banks of all sizes, including community banks, can benefit from efficiency gains that flow from asset tokenization. New technology and processes can open the door to direct, faster, and lower cost payments.\n\nWhile tokenization may be part of the solution to a number of known frictions in the banking system, the blockchain technology that it relies upon has already changed how banks seek to engage with their customers. For example, while digital assets have been considered to be risky, many banks are improving their tech stacks and security infrastructure to provide digital asset custody services to a wider range of retail customers. Very few bankers, and even fewer regulators, anticipated that the market would accommodate this development even just a few years ago. Yet we've seen much progress and a growing appetite for traditional bank engagement in this space. We are also seeing positive signs in the evolution of the digital asset user experience, making digital assets more accessible and easier to use.\n\nOne recent development—Congress passing the GENIUS Act and the President signing it into law—has brought stablecoins to the forefront of many discussions. And they are now positioned to become a fixture in the financial system, with implications and opportunities for the traditional banking system, including the potential to disrupt traditional payment rails. Congress tasked the banking agencies with creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and we are working with our colleagues in the other agencies to move forward.\n\nIt is essential that banks and regulators are open to engaging in new technologies and departing from an overly cautious mindset. Regulators must understand new products and services and recognize the utility and necessity of embracing technology in the traditional financial sector.\n\nSo how do we accomplish this? Some of you may have had direct experience with regulators and the banking system, as you attempted to engage in this type of partnership with banks through the introduction of new technology and services. I am sure that many of you were not satisfied with these interactions. When you start from a world of possibility, where you move fast and break things to make rapid improvements, you may struggle with the complex and rigid regulatory constructs familiar to bankers and regulators. In this world, inertia can easily set in and pose resistance to anything not deemed within the realm of \"traditional\" banking activities.\n\nDespite this past inertia, change is coming.\n\nBank regulators are taking important steps to create a framework for digital assets and the adoption of blockchain technology within the banking system. These steps will promote accessibility to banking products and services by removing supervisory impediments that have stood in the way of bank relationships. I am also encouraged by the promise of this technology, by its ability to solve problems and improve the efficiency of the traditional financial system.\n\nTo this point, I have noted several use cases that have already been adopted or are in development within the banking system, but I would also like to encourage the industry to engage with regulators to help us understand blockchain and its potential to solve other problems. What is the value proposition of any new product or approach? What problem is it intended to address? And how should regulators consider both the risks and benefits, so we can provide a path to allow its use within the banking system?\n\nWe have already seen some initial benefits of bank AI adoption, and I continue to be encouraged by the significant ongoing investments being made in AI and in machine learning. These technologies have the potential to transform how business is conducted, including the way we detect and prevent fraud, manage risk, and provide customer service. During a recent banking conference at the Fed, Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI, joined me for a fireside chat on AI in the banking and financial sector.2One highlight from our discussion was the two-sided nature of how technology can impact banking transactions—just as AI can undermine customer verification methods designed to identify and mitigate fraud, AI tools can also be leveraged to detect and mitigate fraud.\n\nI see a similar challenge with blockchain technologies. Some bankers have expressed concerns about new technologies posing a threat to traditional business models and practices. But the banking system is constantly evolving, and technology can change the banking system regardless of how banks and regulators choose to respond. We must choose whether to embrace the change and help shape a framework that will be reliable and durable—ensuring safety and soundness and incorporating the benefits of both efficiency and speed—or to stand still and allow new technology to bypass the traditional banking system altogether. From a regulator's perspective, the choice is clear.\n\nI am open to these discussions, and I look forward to learning more. Many of you have a great deal to share and have new ideas about the best regulatory approach to blockchain and digital assets. Let me start with a specific request on fraud: how can new technologies be leveraged to fight fraud? Fraud is a major challenge in the financial services sector, and if blockchain or other new tools could mitigate it, we should explore those use cases. If fraud can be addressed using new technology, we should make sure that the regulatory framework does not stand in the way. I see this as an exciting opportunity for collaboration between industry and the Fed.3\n\nThe promise of technology and advances like AI are already positioned to impact parts of the banking and financial system. Ideally, changes will occur with the willing embrace of regulators—allowing use cases to proliferate in a way that benefits the banking system. If this is not our approach, then we risk the banking system becoming less relevant to consumers, businesses, and the overall economy. As a result, the banks will play a diminished role in the financial system more broadly. Those who follow developments in bank regulation have hopefully recognized some positive steps that demonstrate our commitment to embrace change. I am committed to changing our culture and attitude toward the adoption and integration of technology and new products and services.\n\nThe Hidden Role of Reputational RiskIn late June, the Board announced that reputational risk would no longer be considered in our supervisory process.4To implement this lasting change, we are updating guidance, examination manuals, handbooks, and other supervisory materials to ensure the durability of this approach, which is a critical step in addressing the problem of de-banking. I am also considering whether we need a regulatory change to provide greater transparency and certainty about this approach. It is not the role of examiners or policymakers to direct which customers or industries to serve or which products to offer. That decision lies solely within the purview of bank management, limited by the safety and soundness of the institution,, the legal activities of its customer, and risks, if any, to financial stability.\n\nOver time, \"reputational risk\" emerged as a priority area that policymakers emphasized for examinations. Exams or reviews focused on reputational risk have often lacked a sufficient nexus to financial risk and safety and soundness considerations that are the appropriate focus of our supervisory activities.\n\nLet me be clear. We must adopt an approach that does not penalize or prohibit a bank from banking a customer engaged in legal activity. This approach must allow and encourage banks to provide banking products and services to any legal business, without disfavoring any particular viewpoints, businesses, or industries.\n\nThe Importance of OutreachThe industry—whether traditional finance, community banking, or digital assets—should expect a constructive engagement with our supervisors when discussing strategies and approaches for innovation. As regulators, we must engage in a way that enables our supervisory teams to understand the technology or innovation under consideration and have an open-minded view about the benefits and possibilities of a new approach, while also understanding effective mitigation strategies to address any risks. Banks should be encouraged to explore new technology, to engage in discussions with their regulators about how they can be deployed, and what reasonable supervisory expectations should apply. In this context, a healthy dialogue and a commitment to learning ensures the bank and examiner relationship can be collaborative rather than antagonistic in tone.\n\nInnovators, banks, and regulators must develop a constructive relationship, and this relies on a commitment to ongoing outreach. As I have demonstrated throughout my tenure as a regulator at both the state and federal levels, I am committed to outreach that enhances my understanding of industry preferences, challenges and better ways to engage with both developers and adopters. We should build an examination workforce that requires skills development and informed judgement to address evolving business preferences, practices and expectations. In a step toward doing so, last week, I announced that the Fed's \"novel supervision\" activities would be reintegrated into our Reserve Bank examination staff. This will reestablish the role of the normal supervisory process in monitoring banks' so-called \"novel activities.\"5\n\nOur approach should consider allowing Federal Reserve staff to hold de minimus amounts of crypto or other types of digital assets so they can achieve a working understanding of the underlying functionality. While there are many resources available to learn about these financial products, and we will soon be establishing a framework for supervising issuers of these assets, there's no replacement for experimenting and understanding how that ownership and transfer process flows.\n\nI certainly wouldn't trust someone to teach me to ski if they'd never put on skis, regardless of how many books and articles they have read, or even wrote, about it. We should consider whether limits on staff investment activities may be a barrier to recruiting and retaining examiners with the necessary expertise and for existing staff to better understand the technology.\n\nBuilding a Tailored and Proportional Regulatory FrameworkGoing forward it will be necessary to continue to implement a tailored approach to these new technologies in our supervisory activities, an approach that balances the supervisory and regulatory expectations in a way that is commensurate with risk.\n\nWhat would this look like in practice? It needs to include regulatory certainty, tailoring, safety and soundness, consumer protection, and maintaining America's reputation for providing an open environment for innovation. Regulators should abide by these principles in developing this framework.\n\nThe first principle is essential. That is regulatory certainty. Justifying investing in new blockchain development specifically for the banking industry, or even repurposing existing blockchain technologies for this sector, requires significant investment. Why would you make that investment without a clear understanding about how regulators will evaluate new use cases in a highly regulated industry? Would you choose to partner with banks, knowing that this will bring regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty, or would you develop alternatives outside of the banking system? Your industry has already experienced significant frictions with bank regulators applying unclear standards, conflicting guidance, and inconsistent regulatory interpretations. We need a clear, strategic regulatory framework that will facilitate the adoption of new technology, recognizing that in some cases, it may be inadequate and inappropriate to apply existing regulatory guidance to address emerging tech.\n\nHaving clear and transparent rules is not effective if these rules are unnecessarily burdensome and restrictive. So, my second principle is that rules must be well-calibrated and tailored to address risks. Well-calibrated regulation promotes responsible innovation while also aligning incentives for long-term growth and stability. Tailoring rules and supervision requires regulators to approach each use case based on particular facts and circumstances, rather than applying expectations designed for an imaginary \"worst-case\" scenario that differs from the actual use case. We cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. Regulators must recognize the unique features of these new assets and distinguish them from traditional financial instruments or banking products.\n\nA third principle is that frameworks must be consistent with generally applicable rules and requirements. Customer-facing products must comply with consumer protection laws, including those prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. We must think carefully about appropriate regulations to protect consumers and investors, maintain bank safety and soundness, and preserve the stability of the financial system. Any legal framework must also include appropriate Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements, to fulfill the important policy objectives of these requirements.\n\nFinally, we need to build a framework that allows the United States to continue to be the best place in the world to innovate. Failing to do so could jeopardize American competitiveness over the long run. Regulators have taken preliminary steps to support blockchain technology within the banking system, as well as to eliminate deterrents for banks to provide services to the digital asset industry. I am confident that with the benefit of ongoing outreach and education we will build a framework that is fair, efficient, and transparent.\n\nClosing ThoughtsWe stand at a crossroads: we can either seize the opportunity to shape the future or risk being left behind. By embracing innovation with a principled approach, we can define the course of history and fulfill our responsibility to promote the safety and soundness of the banking system and financial stability.\n\nWe are mindful of the potential risks and vulnerabilities that result from rapid transformation. We are cautious about the unintended consequences, and our mindset, and policies guide us toward minimizing risks. But we must pay equal attention to the benefits side of the equation. Innovation and regulation don't need to be on opposite ends of the spectrum. In fact, they complement each other. A more modern, efficient, and effective financial system furthers key regulatory objectives—promoting safe and sound banking operation, financial stability, and economic growth.\n\n1.

Since assuming this important financial regulatory role, we have hit the ground running—addressing some of the most critical matters in the bank regulatory space, all of which fall under the broad categories of improving efficiency, transparency, and fairness. Often, the \"headline\" issues coming out of the Federal Reserve and the other banking regulators are ones that affect the largest firms. And many are critical for both economic growth and financial stability.\n\nBut banks of all sizes, especially community banks, play a vital role in our economy and financial system, and we are continuing to directly engage as we draft regulatory and supervisory reforms. Community banks drive local economic growth, and they play a central role in the financial health of the customers and communities they serve, but these banks also face unique challenges.\n\nI will begin today by sharing my outlook on the economy and an update on the recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) before I dig a bit deeper into community banking issues.\n\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC MeetingAt last week's FOMC meeting, I dissented from the Committee's decision to hold the policy rate at its current level. Today I'd like to share some additional perspective about my views on the economy. So far this year, the FOMC has held the target range for the federal funds rate steady at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Earlier this year, I believed our policy stance was appropriate, giving time to allow the Committee to monitor the progress of inflation toward our goal and to better understand the impacts of the Administration's policies on the economy.\n\nAt the June FOMC meeting and in a speech shortly following that meeting, I began to lay out my reasoning to support the process of beginning to gradually lower the federal funds rate in July based on my assessment of signs of fragility in labor market conditions.2In my view, economic conditions appeared to be shifting, and as a result, we should reflect this shift in our policy decisions. Inflation has moved considerably closer to our target, after excluding temporary effects of tariffs, and the labor market has remained near full employment. As my dissent statement notes, with economic growth slowing this year and signs of a less dynamic labor market becoming clear, I see it as appropriate to begin gradually moving our moderately restrictive policy stance toward a neutral setting. Taking action at last week's meeting would have proactively hedged against the risk of a further erosion in labor market conditions and a further weakening in economic activity.\n\nEconomic Conditions and OutlookThe U.S. economy has been resilient so far this year. Underlying economic growth has slowed markedly, but despite increasing signs of fragility as the latest employment report more clearly shows, the labor market appears to remain near estimates of full employment.\n\nSo far this year, consumer spending softened while residential investment declined, contributing to a much slower increase in private domestic final purchases compared to strong gains in 2024. Consumer spending on both goods and services has risen only modestly, reflecting slow gains in disposable personal income, lower levels of liquid savings, and high credit card utilization by lower-income households. Housing activity has declined, including in single-family home construction and sales, as listings of homes for sale are growing and house prices are falling, which suggests weakness in housing demand to a level last seen during the financial crisis.\n\nAlthough the unemployment rate remained historically low at 4.2 percent in July, the latest employment report confirmed some of the signs of fragility and reduced dynamism in the labor market that I discussed at last week's FOMC meeting without the benefit of having seen the July report. The unemployment rate moved back up in July and was close to rounding up to 4.3 percent, largely reflecting reduced hiring as businesses continue to retain existing workers instead of increasing layoffs. The employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly this year, suggesting more softening in labor market conditions than the unemployment rate implies.\n\nPayroll employment growth slowed sharply to only 35,000 jobs per month over the three months ending in July. This is well below the moderate pace seen earlier in the year, likely due to a significant softening in labor demand. The sharp slowdown partly reflects the downward revision to payroll employment in both May and June, which, to put it in perspective, is comparable only to a few other two-month revisions over the past 30 years. In addition, job gains have been centered in an unusually narrow set of industries that tend to be less affected by the business cycle. For example, healthcare and social services have more than accounted for total job gains over the past three months, and the share of industries with job gains over the last six months dropped in July to a historically low level.\n\nTurning to price stability, the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation stood at 2.8 percent in June, a bit lower than at the end of last year. However, after removing estimates of one-off tariff effects on goods prices, core PCE inflation would have been lower than 2.5 percent in June, which is significant progress and much closer to our 2 percent target. This progress reflects a considerable slowing in core services inflation, which is consistent with recent softness in consumer spending and the labor market no longer being a source of inflation pressures.\n\nThe underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently shown in the data. With housing services inflation on a sustained downward trajectory and other core services inflation already consistent with 2 percent inflation, only core goods inflation remains elevated—likely reflecting limited passthrough from tariffs.\n\nIn terms of risks to achieving our dual mandate, as I gain even greater confidence that tariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation, I see that upside risks to price stability have diminished. With underlying inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should focus on risks to our employment mandate.\n\nWith the memories of pandemic worker shortages still fresh, businesses have chosen to maintain, instead of reducing, their work forces in response to the slowing economic conditions. And they seem to be more willing to reduce profit margins as they are less able to fully pass through higher costs and raise prices given the weakness in demand. If demand conditions continue to soften, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it may not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.\n\nOn trade policy, foreign suppliers are absorbing some of the new tariffs, and importers are shifting to lower tariffed sources. Slack in the economy should also allow for only limited one-time price effects this year and very little, if any, \"second-round\" effects on inflation in the medium term. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment are likely to boost supply and offset any tariff-related effects on economic activity and prices over the medium term.\n\nThe Policy Decision and the Path ForwardWith tariff-related price increases likely representing a one-time effect, my view is that inflation will return to 2 percent after these effects dissipate. Because changes in monetary policy take time to work their way through the economy, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings and therefore remove some policy restraint to avoid weakening in the labor market.\n\nAs I recognize that economic conditions are shifting, I believe that beginning to move our policy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level will help maintain the labor market near full employment and ensure smooth progress toward achieving our dual mandate. I see the risk that a delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in labor market conditions and a further slowing in economic growth.\n\nBefore our next meeting in September, we will receive a range of additional economic data and information, including another employment and two inflation reports. A proactive approach in moving policy closer to neutral, from its current moderately restrictive stance, would help avoid a further unnecessary erosion in labor market conditions and reduce the chance that the Committee will need to implement a larger policy correction should the labor market deteriorate further.\n\nIn my view, it is also important that the Committee's approach to monetary policy decision making is consistent over time—especially when we face shifting economic conditions. I recognize and appreciate that other FOMC members may see things differently and that they were more comfortable with leaving the target range for the policy rate unchanged. I am committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability. In the meantime, I will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data and information as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve.\n\nI have discussed many times in the past that, in recent years, the monthly labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret, in part, reflecting declining survey response rates and the changing dynamics of immigration and net business creation. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture cyclical or structural changes in the labor market in real time so that we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. So, I remain cautious about taking too much signal from data releases, but I see the latest news on economic growth, the labor market, and inflation as consistent with greater risks to the employment side of our dual mandate.\n\nMy Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year, which has been consistent with my forecast since last December, and the latest labor market data reinforce my view. I want to reiterate, though, that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on each of our assessments of the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance going forward.\n\nPrioritizing Community Banking IssuesTurning back to community banking, I'd like to share some thoughts about how we identify the key issues facing community banks and prioritize them in our regulatory and supervisory reform efforts.\n\nMy approach to prioritizing these issues remains consistent and clear—it starts with outreach. Throughout my time as a member of the Board, I have focused on meeting with and listening to community bankers to better understand the unique challenges they face. What are the most significant threats to their business? How have regulations harmed or improved their ability to operate safely and soundly? How have competitive factors evolved within their communities? How do they see the business of banking evolving with the introduction of new technologies? Engaging with you and other community bankers has been a critical input to informing my views on the current state of bank regulation and supervision, which also shapes my priorities for regulatory and supervisory initiatives.\n\nAs regulators seek to identify problems in the bank regulatory system and craft approaches to address them, it is imperative that we focus on issues that impact community banks. And I am very pleased to announce that the Board will host a conference focused on community banking in Washington, D.C., on October 9th to ensure that our work is fully informed. We will bring together bankers, industry experts, academics, and other stakeholders to discuss and identify matters targeted to support our ongoing work.\n\nWe will continue to fully engage and to understand these banks' concerns. And, apart from fraud, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, the Federal Reserve has already started looking at elements of the bank regulatory framework unique to community banks. This includes the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR), liquidity sources and regulatory expectations, and rethinking capital options and operations for mutual banks.\n\nThe CBLR is a good example of a well-intentioned measure that underachieved in providing regulatory relief. The CBLR is an optional framework that was designed as an alternative to risk-based capital measures for community banks. A community bank that complies with the CBLR is deemed to comply with risk-based capital requirements.3\n\nStatutory limitations on the CBLR restricted the framework to between 8 and 10 percent for qualifying community banks.4The agencies initially established the CBLR at 9 percent just as I joined the Board in late 2018.5In rationalizing this setting, the agencies focused primarily on how many banks would be eligible to opt into the framework at their current capital levels and whether it could essentially retain the same high level of capital in the system.\n\nImplicit in this approach seems to be a view that Congress intended the agencies to keep the same overall amount of capital supporting community banks. However, by statute, Congress provided a range, and the low end isdoublethe standard leverage ratio capital requirement of 4 percent. The regulators also retained many of the same restrictive definitions, like the definition of qualifying tier 1 capital with associated exclusions and caps, that apply more generally to the largest institutions. While there were 4,022 community banks as of the first quarter of 2025, only 1,662 had opted into the CBLR.6\n\nNotably, data show that smaller community banks are more likely to have adopted the CBLR framework. About 53 percent of eligible community banks with assets less than $1 billion have opted in, compared to 26 percent of community banks with assets exceeding $1 billion. These smaller community banks play a significant and unique role in the U.S. economy through their support of local businesses, job creation, and investing in their communities.\n\nIn my view, it is time to consider modifications to the CBLR framework that make it a more attractive framework and will encourage more banks to adopt it. We should also consider whether it was appropriately designed and calibrated to fulfill the Congressional intent to achieve regulatory relief. For example, reducing the CBLR requirement from 9 percent to 8 percent could not only allow more community banks to adopt the framework but also increase balance sheet capacity for all CBLR firms, facilitating additional support for local economies through lending.\n\nSince the 2023 failure of Silicon Valley Bank, there has been increased scrutiny on the liquidity sources banks use. Some policymakers have expressed skepticism of long-established and reliable sources of liquidity, particularly liquidity provided by the Federal Home Loan Banks. One proposal, which is perhaps a solution in search of a problem, is to push for an expanded use of the discount window. Under this view, regulators (through requirement or supervisory pressure) would require banks to pledge and maintain assets at the discount window. Banks would be expected to use the discount window as a daily liquidity source, even when other, lower-cost liquidity sources are available like FHLB. But this solution seems to have bypassed the threshold question of whether there is a problem. Effective reform efforts require actual identification of a problem and a practical approach relying on an informed view of the business of banking.\n\nOther small bank concerns have persisted for even longer. Mutual banks have existed since the early 1800s but have long faced limited capital options and restrictions on managing capital distributions.7I have spoken about these issues in detail in the past, so I will not rehash them today. In the past, when regulators prioritized regulatory reform by asset size alone, they neglected critical issues that affect smaller institutions. Our responsibilities as prudential regulators should be broadly focused on banks of all sizes, ensuring relief across the broad range of asset sizes.\n\nWhat I have discussed so far today is not an exhaustive list of the work underway at the Board and in partnership with the other agencies. On June 23, the Board announced that reputational risk would no longer be considered in the examination process.8To implement this lasting change, we are updating guidance, examination manuals, handbooks, and other supervisory materials to ensure the durability of this approach, which is a critical step in addressing the problem of de-banking. A few additional initiatives include changes to provide transparency and efficiency in the supervisory process, better defining \"safety and soundness,\" reviewing and updating relevant asset thresholds used in establishing supervisory categories and regulatory requirements, and rationalizing and updating Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements.\n\nWe have reached a point of opportunity for community banks. It is time to build a framework that supports their strength and vitality, recognizing their unique characteristics so they can prosper long into the future.\n\nFraud in the Financial SystemWhile the upcoming community bank conference will enable us to explore a number of new and longstanding challenges, we are already aware of many that demand attention. Direct outreach with the banking industry has provided insight into economic and financial conditions across a wide range of communities and a close-up perspective of bankers' concerns. A common theme from these discussions is that fraud continues to pose material challenges and risks to banks and their customers. The sophistication of the techniques fraudsters use has greatly expanded, yet the tools to detect fraud have not kept pace.\n\nConsider the fraud risks introduced by artificial intelligence (AI). During a recent banking conference at the Fed, Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI joined me for a fireside chat on AI in the banking and financial industry.9The discussion highlighted how AI can be used to undermine common multifactor security measures. Banks must be able to identify new types of fraud where AI tools mimic customer voices and images, including by video. It is important that AI developers, bankers, and regulators focus on developing tools that can detect this type of activity enabling them to confirm a customer's identity in real time, training their teams to spot signs of AI-driven impersonation.\n\nWhile banks have important responsibilities to detect and prevent fraud, we should also consider proposals to help mitigate the risks of fraud. For example, liability for fraud may not always rest with those best positioned to prevent or detect it. Limits on information sharing among firms may leave them more vulnerable to fraud threats and activities. This vulnerability could be addressed through better socialization of the methods and approaches criminals use to perpetrate fraud, and more effective enforcement and information sharing among law enforcement and financial institutions.\n\nIn addition, in mid-June, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC published a request for information (RFI) seeking comment on addressing payments and check fraud.10Check fraud has grown substantially over the past several years, resulting in financial harm to banks, especially community banks, and the consumers and businesses who are the victims of fraud. While this has been a well-known problem for several years, efforts by regulators have been slow to advance and seem to have done little to address this growing threat.\n\nWhile the RFI is an important first step, addressing fraud will require a coordinated strategy involving banks, federal and state regulators, law enforcement, bank customers, the postal service, and others in the payments and tech industry. We must improve communication, ensure that there's appropriate accountability and that responsibility for preventing fraud and liability are appropriately assigned, and revise outdated regulations like Regulation CC implementing the Expedited Funds Availability Act.\n\nThe RFI comment period closes on September 18, and I encourage all stakeholders to share their views. We must have a comprehensive strategy to develop and implement an effective, coordinated approach, and your input is vital to getting that approach right. I look forward to reviewing these comments.\n\nClosing ThoughtsCommunity banks are the cornerstone of the banking and financial system, supporting local communities and their customers. Too often, these banks have been overlooked, with too little attention paid to longstanding and emerging issues and industry and consumer concerns.\n\nThe Fed's upcoming community bank conference will provide a welcome opportunity to hear from bankers, industry, and academics about the unique issues and challenges they face. Looking ahead, I will continue to include and prioritize a review, refinement, and reform of regulations to address these concerns.\n\n1.

As the Committee's post-meeting statement notes, I preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.1\n\nInflation has moved considerably closer to our target, after excluding temporary effects from tariffs, and the labor market remains near full employment. With economic growth slowing this year and signs of a less dynamic labor market, I saw it as appropriate to begin gradually moving our moderately restrictive policy stance toward a neutral setting. In my view, this action would have proactively hedged against a further weakening in the economy and the risk of damage to the labor market.\n\nThe U.S. Economy Has Remained ResilientThe U.S. economy has remained resilient in the first half of the year. Although underlying economic growth has slowed markedly, the labor market has remained stable near estimates of full employment. We have also seen meaningful progress in lowering inflation toward our 2 percent target, excluding tariff-related increases in goods prices.\n\nPrivate domestic final purchases have increased at a much slower pace this year as compared to strong gains in 2024, reflecting softening consumer spending, and declining residential investment. This weakness in demand likely reflects elevated interest rates, slower growth in personal income, and smaller liquid asset buffers and elevated credit card utilization rates among lower-income households.\n\nTotal payroll employment continued to increase moderately, and the unemployment rate remained historically low in June. However, the labor market has become less dynamic and shows increasing signs of fragility. The employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly this year, businesses are reducing hiring but continue to retain their existing workers, and job gains have been centered in an unusually narrow set of industries that are less affected by the business cycle, including health care and social services.\n\nIn the absence of tariff effects on goods prices, the 12-month change in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices would have been less than 2.5 percent in June, lower than its elevated reading of 2.9 percent in December and considerably closer to our 2 percent target. This progress reflects the recent considerable slowing in core PCE services inflation, which is consistent with recent softness in consumer spending and the labor market no longer being a source of inflation pressures.\n\nIncreased Concerns about Our Employment MandateIn terms of risks to achieving our dual mandate, I see that upside risks to price stability have diminished as I gain even greater confidence that tariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation. With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should start putting more weight on risks to our employment mandate.\n\nThus far, with the memories of pandemic worker shortages still fresh, firms have resisted reducing their work forces in response to the slowing economic conditions. And they have appeared to be more willing to reduce profit margins as they are less able to fully pass through higher costs and raise prices given the weakness in demand. If demand conditions do not improve, firms may have little option other than to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it may not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.\n\nThe Policy Path as I See ItWith tariff-related price increases likely representing a one-time effect, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings. As I recognize that economic conditions are shifting, I believe that beginning to move our policy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level will help maintain the labor market near full employment and ensure smooth progress toward achieving both of our dual-mandate goals.

Waller", "description": "Speech", "category": "Speech", "pub_date": "Fri, 1 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT", "content": "At the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I dissented because I concluded that cutting the policy rate by 25 basis points was the appropriate stance of policy. In a speech I gave July 17, I laid out the case for cutting the policy rate at the July FOMC meeting and my views have not changed since then. I will recap the reasons for doing so.\n\nFirst, tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary increase. Standard central banking practice is to \"look through\" such price-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are.\n\nSecond, a host of data argues that monetary policy should now be close to neutral, not restrictive. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was 1.2 percent in the first half of this year and is expected to remain soft for the rest of 2025, much lower than the median of FOMC participants' estimates of longer-run GDP growth. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the Committee's longer-run estimate, and total inflation is close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent if we put aside tariff effects that I believe will be temporary. Taken together, the data imply the policy rate should be around neutral, which the median FOMC participant estimates is 3 percent, and not where we are—1.25 to 1.50 percentage points above 3 percent.\n\nMy final reason to favor a cut now is that while the labor market looks fine on the surface, once we account for expected data revisions, private-sector payroll growth is near stall speed, and other data suggest that the downside risks to the labor market have increased. With underlying inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\n\nI fully respect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC that suggest we need to take a \"wait and see\" approach regarding tariffs' effects on inflation. There is nothing wrong about having different views about how to interpret incoming data and using different economic arguments to predict how tariffs will impact the economy. These differences are a sign of a healthy and robust policy discussion.\n\nBut, I believe that the wait and see approach is overly cautious, and, in my opinion, does not properly balance the risks to the outlook and could lead to policy falling behind the curve. The price effects from tariffs have been small so far, and since we will likely not get clarity on tariff levels or their ultimate impact on the economy over the course of the next several months, it is possible that the labor market falters before that clarity is obtained—if it ever is obtained. When labor markets turn, they often turn fast. If we find ourselves needing to support the economy, waiting may unduly delay moving toward appropriate policy.\n\nMy position does not mean I believe the FOMC should reduce the policy rate along a predetermined path. We can cut now and see how the data evolves. If the tariff effects do not lead to a major shock to inflation, the Committee can continue reducing the rate at a moderate pace. If we do get significant upside surprises to inflation and employment, we can pause. But I see no reason that we should hold the policy rate at its current level and risk a sudden decline in the labor market.", "content_length": 3354, "scraped_at": "2025-10-03T10:34:16.429456+00:00"}

I am pleased, though not surprised, to see such great interest in the topic of today's conference—the integrated review of the capital framework for large banks. I want to thank Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman for having the great idea of holding this event at the outset of her term. I would also like to thank Fed staff for their tireless work in putting the conference together.\n\nToday we will hear the perspectives of industry veterans, academics, and current and former policymakers who are all well-versed in the operations of large banks and the main pillars of the capital framework. A great benefit of this conference is the chance to consider all elements of the capital framework in concert, rather than look at each in isolation. We need to ensure that all the different pieces of the capital framework work together effectively. Doing so will help maintain a safe, sound, and efficient banking system, for the benefit of the people we serve. The U.S. bank capital framework includes risk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, the surcharge for the largest and most complex banks, and the stress tests. We will discuss the status of each of those elements, and the road ahead, in a comprehensive manner. As this audience will know, we have proposals outstanding or in the works across all four areas.\n\nOur regulatory capital framework and all banking rules are implemented through supervision, an area where Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman brings deep experience as a former banker and state supervisor. As she has noted, we need to make sure that our supervisory practices focus on the critical areas that determine safety and soundness. We need our large banks to be well capitalized and to manage their key risks well. And we need large banks to be free to compete with one another, with nonbank financial firms, and with banks in other jurisdictions to provide capital and support economic growth.\n\nThe Fed is a dynamic institution. We are open to hearing new ideas and feedback on how to improve the capital framework for large banks, and I look forward to hearing from today's participants. Thank you again for joining us today.", "content_length": 2588, "scraped_at": "2025-10-03T10:34:16.695498+00:00"}
